  abstract = {With designers constantly working for clients and having a limited amount of freedom in much of their work, the chance to strike out on their own and do something truly original and personal is a real luxury. The cards included represent some of the most creative design available so are a wonderful source of inspiration for all types of projects. All designers and design firms, whether in-house or freelance, create their own greeting cards which serve not only as a greeting card, but as an opportunity to show off their work in a totally unique and uninhibited light. In addition, they are the perfect project because they are small enough so they are not incredibly time consuming nor are they very expensive to produce -- even with unique materials or treatments.},

Descriptions of the animations were rated according to accuracy and type of description. Adults predominantly used action descriptions for Random animations (e.g. bouncing), interaction descriptions for Goal-directed (G-D) sequences (fighting), and mentalising descriptions for Theory of Mind (ToM) sequences (tricking). High-functioning children with autism used mentalising descriptions less often than normally developing 8year-olds, but as often as did children with general intellectual impairment. However, the autism group frequently referred to mental states that were inappropriate to the animation. Even those children with autism who passed standard false belief tasks showed inappropriate descriptions of ToM animations, revealing continuing impairments in mentalising on-line.

  abstract = {Long before the United States became a major force in global affairs, Americans believed in their superiority over others due to their inventiveness, productivity, and economic and social well-being. U.S. expansionists assumed a mandate to “civilize” non-Western peoples by demanding submission to American technological prowess and design. As an integral part of America’s national identity and sense of itself in the world, this civilizing mission provided the rationale to displace the Indians from much of our continent, to build an island empire in the Pacific and Caribbean, and to promote unilateral—at times military—interventionism throughout Asia. In our age of “smart bombs” and mobile warfare, technological aptitude remains preeminent in validating America’s global mission.   Michael Adas brilliantly pursues the history of this mission through America's foreign relations over nearly four centuries from North America to the Philippines, Vietnam, and the Persian Gulf. The belief that it is our right and destiny to remake foreign societies in our image has endured from the early decades of colonization to our current crusade to implant American-style democracy in the Muslim Middle East.   Dominance by Design explores the critical ways in which technological superiority has undergirded the U.S.’s policies of unilateralism, preemption, and interventionism in foreign affairs and raised us from an impoverished frontier nation to a global power. Challenging the long-held assumptions and imperatives that sustain the civilizing mission, Adas gives us an essential guide to America’s past and present role in the world as well as cautionary lessons for the future.},

  abstract = {Over the past five centuries, advances in Western understanding of and control over the material world have strongly influenced European responses to non-Western peoples and cultures. In Machines as the Measure of Men, Michael Adas explores the ways in which European perceptions of their scientific and technological superiority shaped their interactions with people overseas. Adopting a broad, comparative perspective, he analyzes European responses to the cultures of sub-Saharan Africa, India, and China, cultures that they judged to represent lower levels of material mastery and social organization.    	Beginning with the early decades of overseas expansion in the sixteenth century, Adas traces the impact of scientific and technological advances on European attitudes toward Asians and Africans and on their policies for dealing with colonized societies. He concentrates on British and French thinking in the nineteenth century, when, he maintains, scientific and technological measures of human worth played a critical role in shaping arguments for the notion of racial supremacy and the "civilizing mission" ideology which were used to justify Europe's domination of the globe. Finally, he examines the reasons why many Europeans grew dissatisfied with and even rejected this gauge of human worth after World War I, and explains why it has remained important to Americans.    	Showing how the scientific and industrial revolutions contributed to the development of European imperialist ideologies, Machines as the Measure of Men highlights the cultural factors that have nurtured disdain for non-Western accomplishments and value systems. It also indicates how these attitudes, in shaping policies that restricted the diffusion of scientific knowledge, have perpetuated themselves, and contributed significantly to chronic underdevelopment throughout the developing world. Adas's far-reaching and provocative book will be compelling reading for all who are concerned about the history of Western imperialism and its legacies.    	First published to wide acclaim in 1989, Machines as the Measure of Men is now available in a new edition that features a preface by the author that discusses how subsequent developments in gender and race studies, as well as global technology and politics, enter into conversation with his original arguments.},

But who is the protagonist of that history that is coming—or has come—to a close? What is man? How did he come on the scene? And how has he maintained his privileged place as the master of, or first among, the animals?In The Open, contemporary Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben considers the ways in which the "human" has been thought of as either a distinct and superior type of animal, or a kind of being that is essentially different from animal altogether. In an argument that ranges from ancient Greek, Christian, and Jewish texts to twentieth-century thinkers such as Heidegger, Benjamin, and Kojève, Agamben examines the ways in which the distinction between man and animal has been manufactured by the logical presuppositions of Western thought, and he investigates the profound implications that the man/animal distinction has had for disciplines as seemingly disparate as philosophy, law, anthropology, medicine, and politics.},

The Take Smart Notes principle is based on established psychological insight and draws from a tried and tested note-taking-technique. This is the first comprehensive guide and description of this system in English, and not only does it explain how it works, but also why. It suits students and academics in the social sciences and humanities, nonfiction writers and others who are in the business of reading, thinking and writing. Instead of wasting your time searching for notes, quotes or references, you can focus on what really counts: thinking, understanding and developing new ideas in writing. It does not matter if you prefer taking notes with pen and paper or on a computer, be it Windows, Mac or Linux. And you can start right away.},

It provides an accessible, informative and engaging intro- duction to important people and companies, events, concepts and practices that have def ined the complementary fields of theatre and performance studies. Three easy-to-use alphabetized sections include more than 140 entries on topics and people ranging from performance artist Marina Abramovito directors Vsevolod Meyerhold and Robert Wilson, the Living Theatre's Paradise Now, the haka, multimedia performance, political protest and visual theatre. Each entry includes important historical and contextual information, extensive cross-referencing, detailed analysis and an annotated bibliography. The Routledge Companion to Theatre and Performance is a perfect reference guide for the keen student and the passionate theatre-goer alike. Paul Allain, Professor of Theatre and Performance at the University of Kent, has published extensively on Jerzy Grotowski, Polish and Russian theatre and intercultural performer training processes.

In this Very Short Introduction, Robert C. Allen shows how the interplay of geography, globalization, technological change, and economic policy has determined the wealth and poverty of nations. Allen shows how the industrial revolution was Britain's path-breaking response to the challenge of globalization. Western Europe and North America joined Britain to form a club of rich nations, pursuing four polices--creating a national market by abolishing internal tariffs and investing in transportation, erecting an external tariff to protect their fledgling industries from British competition, creating banks to stabilize the currency and mobilize domestic savings for investment, and promoting mass education to prepare people for industrial work. Together these countries pioneered new technologies that have made them ever richer. A few countries--Japan, Soviet Russia, South Korea, Taiwan, and perhaps China--have caught up with the West through creative responses to the technological challenge and with Big Push industrialization that has achieved rapid growth through coordinated investment.},

It is the basis of the new approach in computing where we do not write programs but collect data; the idea is to learn the algorithms for the tasks automatically from data. As computing devices grow more ubiquitous, a larger part of our lives and work is recorded digitally, and as “Big Data” has gotten bigger, the theory of machine learning—the foundation of efforts to process that data into knowledge—has also advanced. In this book, machine learning expert Ethem Alpaydin offers a concise overview of the subject for the general reader, describing its evolution, explaining important learning algorithms, and presenting example applications.Alpaydin offers an account of how digital technology advanced from number-crunching mainframes to mobile devices, putting today's machine learning boom in context. He describes the basics of machine learning and some applications; the use of machine learning algorithms for pattern recognition; artificial neural networks inspired by the human brain; algorithms that learn associations between instances, with such applications as customer segmentation and learning recommendations; and reinforcement learning, when an autonomous agent learns act so as to maximize reward and minimize penalty. Alpaydin then considers some future directions for machine learning and the new field of “data science,” and discusses the ethical and legal implications for data privacy and security.},

Everyone likes to be admired, but when it comes to kids actually killing each other"—he pauses—"then you have to reevaluate things." We certainly do. In a country that has long been hung up on style over substance, flash over depth, the athletic shoe and sportswear industries (a projected \$5.5 billion in domestic sales of name-brand shoes in 1990; more than \$2 billion in sweatpants, sweatshirts and warmup suits) suddenly have come to represent the pinnacle of consumer exploitation. In recent months the industries, which include heavyweights Nike and Reebok as well as smaller players Adidas, Asics, British Knights, Brooks, Converse, Ellesse, Etonic, Fila, L.A. Gear, New Balance, Pony, Puma, Starter and numerous other makers of sports shoes, caps and jackets, have been accused of creating a fantasy-fueled market for luxury items in the economically blasted inner cities and willingly tapping into the flow of drug and gang money. This has led to a frightening outbreak of crimes among poor black kids trying to make their mark by "busting fresh," or dressing at the height of fashion.},

Instrumenting for roadshow destinations using the location of theaters prior to the movie’s release, I show that the film significantly increased local Klan support in the 1920s. Roadshow counties continue to experience higher rates of hate crimes and hate groups a century later.},

  address = {London; New York},
  abstract = {"In this new book, cultural thinker Ien Ang engages with urgent questions of identity in an age of globalization and diaspora. The starting-point for Ang's discussion is the experience of visiting Taiwan. Ang, a person of Chinese descent, born in Indonesia and raised in the Netherlands, found herself 'faced with an almost insurmountable difficulty' - surrounded by people who expected her to speak to them in Chinese. She writes: 'It was the beginning of an almost decade-long engagement with the predicaments of "Chineseness" in diaspora. In Taiwan I was different because I couldn't speak Chinese; in the West I was different because I looked Chinese.'" "From this autobiographical beginning, Ang goes on to reflect upon tensions between 'Asia' and 'the West' at a national and global level, and to consider the disparate meanings of 'Chineseness' in the contemporary world. She offers a critique of the increasingly aggressive construction of a global Chineseness, and challenges Western tendencies to equate 'Chinese' with 'Asian' identity." "Ang then turns to 'the West', exploring the paradox of Australia's identity as a 'Western' country in the Asian region, and tracing Australia's uneasy relationship with its Asian neighbours, from the White Australia policy to contemporary multicultural society. Finally, Ang draws together her discussion of 'Asia' and 'the West' to consider the social and intellectual space of the 'in-between', arguing for a theorizing not of 'difference' but of 'togetherness' in contemporary societies."--Jacket.},

  abstract = {Hannah Arendt was born in Germany in 1906 and lived in America from 1941 until her death in 1975. Thus her life spanned the tumultuous years of the twentieth century, as did her thought. She did not consider herself a philosopher, though she studied and maintained close relationships with two great philosophers—Karl Jaspers and Martin Heidegger—throughout their lives. She was a thinker, in search not of metaphysical truth but of the meaning of appearances and events. She was a questioner rather than an answerer, and she wrote what she thought, principally to encourage others to think for themselves. Fearless of the consequences of thinking, Arendt found courage woven in each and every strand of human freedom.~In 1951 she published The Origins of Totalitarianism, in 1958 The Human Condition, in 1961 Between Past and Future, in 1963 On Revolution and Eichmann in Jerusalem, in 1968 Men in Dark Times, in 1970 On Violence, in 1972 Crises of the Republic, and in 1978, posthumously, The Life of the Mind. Starting at the turn of the twenty-first century, Schocken Books has published a series of collections of Arendt’s unpublished and uncollected writings, of which Thinking Without a Banister is the fifth volume.~~The title refers to Arendt’s description of her experience of thinking, an activity she indulged without any of the traditional religious, moral, political, or philosophic pillars of support. The book’s contents are varied: the essays, lectures, reviews, interviews, speeches, and editorials, taken together, manifest the relentless activity of her mind as well as her character, acquainting the reader with the person Arendt was, and who has hardly yet been appreciated or understood.~(Edited and with an introduction by Jerome Kohn)},

  abstract = {수사학은 다른 사람을 설득하기 위한 언어기법을 연구하는 학문의 한 분과이다. 정의를 현실 세계에서 실현하고자 했던 아리스토텔레스 사상의 관점에서 보자면, 『수사학』은 그 정점에 있는 저술이다. 왜냐하면 수사학은 그가 제시한 변증학을 기반으로 자신의 윤리학과 정치학을, 대중 연설과 법정에서 현실 정치로 구현해내는 기술이었기 때문이다. 20세기에 들어와서는 논증 수사학, 문예 수사학, 기호론적·언어학적 수사학에 의한 담론 연구가 활발해지면서 새로운 수사학이 관심 받고 있으나, 아리스토텔레스의 『수사학』은 2,400년 동안 수사학 체계에서 ‘논증’ 이론에 관한 성찰의 기본서가 되었다. 아리스토텔레스의 『수사학』은 로마의 키케로와 퀸틸리아누스를 거쳐 중세에 이르기까지 많은 영향을 미쳤으며, 현대에도 아리스토텔레스의 『수사학』을 빼놓고 새로운 수사학을 논한다는 것은 불가능하다. 당시 소피스트들은 정의와 윤리를 다 배제한 채로 오직 사람들의 감정을 움직여 자기 목적을 달성하려고 한 반면에, 아리스토텔레스는 변증학적 기초 위에서 어떤 것이 국가에 이롭고 정의로우며 훌륭한 것인지를 개연적으로 증명해내는 수사학이야말로 ‘설득의 기술’로서 가장 좋은 수단이 된다고 생각했다. 아리스토텔레스의 『수사학』은 세 권으로 구성되어 있다. 제1권에서는 전체적으로 내용을 개관한 후에, 연설가가 사용해야 할 설득 수단이자 수사학에서 다루어야 할 내용 중 논리적 추론에 해당하는 ‘로고스’와 관련한 전제들을 집중 설명한다. 제2권에서는 ‘에토스’와 ‘파토스’를 설명한다. 마지막으로 제3권은 연설가가 신경 써야 할 추가 문제, 즉 문체와 배열, 그리고 전달의 문제를 다룬다.},

  abstract = {Aristotle, great Greek philosopher, researcher, reasoner, and writer, born at Stagirus in 384 BCE, was the son of Nicomachus, a physician, and Phaestis. He studied under Plato at Athens and taught there (367–347); subsequently he spent three years at the court of a former pupil, Hermeias, in Asia Minor and at this time married Pythias, one of Hermeias's relations. After some time at Mitylene, in 343–2 he was appointed by King Philip of Macedon to be tutor of his teen-aged son Alexander. After Philip's death in 336, Aristotle became head of his own school (of 'Peripatetics'), the Lyceum at Athens. Because of anti-Macedonian feeling there after Alexander's death in 323, he withdrew to Chalcis in Euboea, where he died in 322.Nearly all the works Aristotle prepared for publication are lost; the priceless ones extant are lecture-materials, notes, and memoranda (some are spurious). They can be categorized as follows: I Practical: Nicomachean Ethics; Great Ethics (Magna Moralia); Eudemian Ethics; Politics; Economics (on the good of the family); On Virtues and Vices. II Logical: Categories; Analytics (Prior and Posterior); Interpretation; Refutations used by Sophists; Topica. III Physical: Twenty-six works (some suspect) including astronomy, generation and destruction, the senses, memory, sleep, dreams, life, facts about animals, etc. IV Metaphysics: on being as being. V Art: Rhetoric and Poetics. VI Other works including the Constitution of Athens; more works also of doubtful authorship. VII Fragments of various works such as dialogues on philosophy and literature; and of treatises on rhetoric, politics and metaphysics.The Loeb Classical Library edition of Aristotle is in twenty-three volumes.},

Despite this, and perhaps in part because of its prevalence in the media, it is often denigrated as trivial and superficial, as a sign of vanity and narcissism. Written by a highly regarded authority on twentieth-century fashion, this Very Short Introduction offer a wide-ranging and revealing look at fashion that discusses everything from production and design, to couture and retailing, to the wider role of fashion in society. This lively book illuminates the structure of the fashion industry and the range of professionals involved in its creation, and it provides cogent insight into its historical, social and cultural contexts. It also sheds light on how fashion has developed, while raising questions about its ethical and controversial aspects, such as the use of fur, exploitative trading, and poor working conditions for laborers.--},

  abstract = {Josef Svoboda (May 10, 1920 in Čáslav - April 8, 2002 in Prague) was a Czech artist and scenic designer. Svoboda was born in Čáslav, Czechoslovakia (today the Czech Republic). He began his training as an architect at the Central School of Housing in Prague. At the end of World War II he became interested in theatre and design. He began to study scenography at the Prague Conservatory and architecture at the Academy of Applied Arts. Svoboda became the principal designer at the Czech National Theatre in 1948 and held that position for more than 30 years. His multimedia installations Laterna Magika and Polyekran with director Alfréd Radok allowed him to be internationally known in 1958. These productions introduced the combination of live actors and filmed projections. Svoboda is also responsible for introducing modern technologies and materials such as plastics, hydraulics and lasers into his designs. In 1967 Svoboda created one of is best known special effects, a three-dimensional pillar of light. This was created by the use of an aerosol mixture which revealed low-voltage luminaries. Josef Svoboda considered himself a scenographer rather than a designer; he chose to show a more holistic, architectural, non-naturalistic approach to design. His 700 plus designs include Insect Comedy (Czech National Theatre, 1946); Rusalka (Teatro La Fenice, Venice, 1958); Carmen (Metropolitan Opera, New York City, 1972); The Firebird (Royal Danish Theatre, Copenhagen, 1972); I Vespri Siliciani (Metropolitan Opera, 1974); Jumpers (Kennedy Center, 1974), many of them realized together with the opera director Václav Kašlík. He left the Czech National Theatre in 1992. In 1993, he became artistic director of the Laterna Magika Theatre. Svobodas honors and awards include honorary doctorates from the Royal College of Arts in London, Denison and Western Michigan universities in the United States, and awards from the United States Institute for Theatre Technology (USITT). He was made Chevalier dans l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in Paris in 1976, and received the French Legion of Honor in 1993. Josef Svoboda was laid to rest in Prague on April 15, 2002.

  abstract = {There is apparently a paradox in that, as artists, some of us become progressively process-oriented, but continue to produce art objects. For me this is necessary since I work on two levels from a common set of attitudes: on the social level, elaborating plans for a Cybernetic Art Matrix; on the intimate level making individual art works. Both processes are concerned with creating triggers--initiating creative behaviour in the observer/participant. Modern art is characterized by a behaviourist tendency in which process and system are cardinal factors. As distinctions between music, painting, poetry, etc. become blurred and media are mixed, a behaviourist synthesis is seen to evolve, in which dialogue and feedback within a social culture indicate the emergence of a Cybernetic vision in art as in science. My artifacts come out of a process of random behaviour interacting with pre-established conditions. The Cybernetic Art Matrix is seen as a process in which anarchic group behaviour interacts with pre-established systems of communications, hardware and learning nets. In both cases the processes are self-generating and self-critical. Basically they are initiated by creative behaviour, and in turn give rise to its extension in other people. /// Il existe un paradoxe apparent en ce que, comme artistes, nous nous orientons peu à peu vers un processus tout en continuant à produire des objets d'art. Dans mon cas cela est nécessaire parce que je travaille sur deux plans, à partir d'un ensemble commun d'attitudes: sur le plan social, en élaborant des projets pour une Matrice d'Art Cybernétique; sur le plan individuel, en créant des oeuvres d'art personnelles. Ces deux processus ont pour but de susciter des déclics--ils déclenchent un comportement créateur chez le spectateur-participant. L'art moderne est caractérisé par une tendance behaviouriste dont le processus et le système sont les facteurs essentiels. Du fait que les différences entre la musique, la peinture, la poésie, etc., tendent à s'estomper et que les media se confondent, l'élaboration d'une synthèse behaviouriste est indispensable, où le dialogue et le 'feedback' au sein d'une culture sociale désignent l'émergence d'une Vision Cybernétique de l'art et des sciences. Les objets que j'ai réalisés sont le résultat d'un processus du comportement, laissé au hasard, et mis en relation avec des conditions pré-établies. La Matrice d'art Cybernétique est envisagée comme étant un processus dans lequel un comportement anarchique de groupe est mis en contact avec des systèmes de communication pré-établis, du matériel et des réseaux d'enseignement. Dans les deux cas, les processus se créent et se contrôlent eux-mêmes. Ils sont, à la base, issus d'un comportement créateur et donnent, à leur tour, l'élan à son développement chez le spectateur.},

Fleetingly used in~Difference and Repetition, it remained underexplored in Deleuze’s subsequent work. In this collection of essays numerous contributors offer perspectives on Deleuze’s concept of the dark precursor as it affects artistic research, providing a wide-ranging panorama on the intersection between music, art, philosophy, and scholarship.The forty-eight chapters in this publication present a kaleidoscopic view of different fields of knowledge and artistic practices, exposing for the first time the diversity and richness of a world situated between artistic research and the philosophy of Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari. Within different understandings of artistic research, the authors—composers, architects, performers, philosophers, sculptors, film-makers, painters, writers, and activists—map practices and invent concepts, contributing to a creative expansion of horizons, materials, and methodologies.ContributorsVOLUME 1:~Paulo de Assis, Arno Böhler, Edward Campbell, Diego Castro-Magas, Pascale Criton, Zornitsa Dimitrova, Lois Fitch, Mike Fletcher, Paolo Galli, Lindsay Gianoukas, Keir GoGwilt, Oleg Lebedev, Jimmie LeBlanc, Nicolas Marty, Frédéric Mathevet, Vincent Meelberg, Catarina Pombo Nabais, Tero Nauha, Gabriel Paiuk, Martin Scherzinger, Einar Torfi Einarsson, Steve Tromans, Toshiya Ueno, Susanne Valerie, Audronė ŽukauskaitėVOLUME 2: Éric Alliez, Manola Antonioli, Jūratė Baranova, Zsuzsa Baross, Anna Barseghian, Ian Buchanan, Elena del Río, Luis de Miranda, Lucia D’Errico, Lilija Duoblienė, Adreis Echzehn, Jae Emerling, Verina Gfader, Ronny Hardliz, Rahma Khazam, Stefan Kristensen, Erin Manning, John Miers, Elfie Miklautz, Marc Ngui, Andreia Oliveira, Federica Pallaver, Andrej Radman, Felix Rebolledo, Anne Sauvagnargues, Janae Sholtz, Mhairi Vari, Mick Wilson, Elisabet Yanagisawa},

We studied how prevalent these strategies are and whether even experienced users have problems with searching and re-accessing information. With this aim, we conducted a survey with 236 experienced web users. The results showed that this group has frequently used key strategies (e.g., using several browser windows in parallel) that they find important, whereas some of the strategies that have been suggested in previous studies are clearly less important for them (e.g., including URLs on a webpage). In some aspects, such as query formulation, this group resembles less experienced web users. For instance, we found that most of the respondents had misconceptions about how their search engine handles queries, as well as other problems with information search and re-access. In addition to presenting the prevalence of the strategies and rationales for their use, we present concrete designs solutions and ideas for making the key strategies also available to less experienced users.},

  abstract = {While "screen" is usually considered a word with a Nordic origin, its older and forgotten classical root shows that its semantic field is more curious than media archaeology commonly thinks. Above all, this proves the existence of a long-lasting connection between the screen and the act of seeing, and the very notion of spectacle in its broader sense. Such a different—Latin, Epicurean—etymology of "screen" can put the idea of separation at the heart of the concept of spectacle. From this perspective, the value of a spectacle stems from a vision of difference—the act of spectating being both detached and detaching, as it enables the spectators to take themselves out of the picture, and thus to draw a morale from what they regard as other than themselves. If we bring this understanding of "screen" to the field of film theory, we deal with an idea of experience that has less to do with the notion of engagement adopted by contemporary approaches focusing on affect, emotion, cognition (and neuroscience), and more to do with the disengagement of the spectator from whatever is represented, and even more to do with the added value that such disengagement brings forth.}

He explains in depth the tools Lacan gave him to navigate the extremes of his other two philosophical "masters," Jean-Paul Sartre and Louis Althusser. Élisabeth Roudinesco supplements Badiou's experience with her own perspective on the troubled landscape of the French analytic world since Lacan's death -- critiquing, for example, the link (or lack thereof) between politics and psychoanalysis in Lacan's work, among other issues. Their dynamic dialogue draws readers into an intimate, at times contentious, yet ultimately productive debate that reinvigorates the work of a pivotal twentieth-century thinker.},

The book also provides a history and theory of structuralism and poststructuralism, a unique evaluation of the achievements of French Maoism during the 1970s and the significance of the events of May 1968, and breathtaking analyses of art and literature. As a theoretical synthesis, the book is extraordinary in terms of its originality, breadth and clarity.This is arguably Badiou's most creative and passionate book, encompassing the entire battlefield of contemporary theory, philosophy and psychoanalysis. Available for the first time in English and now in paperback, this is a must-read for anyone interested in this lively and highly original thinker.},

In this way, common design practices can be made explicit and learning effects as well as a strategic control and some ethical monitoring of the systems references involved can be achieved.},

There are three, the distinction of communication between the local and the global, of perception between seeking irritants and protecting against them, and of the computer between predictive data and data space, which produce the ‘reality’ of the next society. A calculus of medium and form describes the operation that differentiates and reproduces a next society whose forms are unstable and whose medium is stable.},

The paper explains the idea of ‘meaning overflow’ in the context of four known media epochs of society, i.e., the oral, the alphabetical, the literate and the current electronic and digital media epoch, and looks for the structure and culture of society that emerge to deal with this overflow. A new structure of society is emerging, one of networks, and a new culture of society is emerging, one of complexity. These new structure and culture add new layers to the already known and still present structures and cultures of earlier media epochs. The paper concludes with the prospect of a calculus of communication, capable of calculating forms within their own medium.},

  author = {Baecker, Dirk},
  year = 1999,
  publisher = {Stanford University Press},
  abstract = {Sociology has long sought to find out how acting in a situation and observing that situation may differ and nevertheless belong to a single kind of social operation. George Spencer-Brown\&\#39;s Laws of Form (1969) provides one way to conceive of such an operation. The present book is the first to make sociological use of his mathematical calculus of form, which has been extensively applied to cybernetics, systems theory, cognitive science, and mathematics.  Spencer-Brown\&\#39;s theory states that any action or communication is always an operation that makes a distinction. Not only does this operation take place, but it can be observed as indicating what it is interested in, and as leaving unmarked what it is not. Distinctions thereby entail a logic of inclusion and exclusion that is subject to social debate and conflict. In social situations there is no action that does not at the same time execute, maintain, or cross a distinction.  Thus the observer is part of the situation he or she observes. The essays in this volume use this idea to describe different social \&quot;forms\&quot; as consisting of action observed by further action. A \&quot;form\&quot; here is understood to be the two sides of a distinction and its dividing line, taken together. All social action, therefore, consists of three values: marked side, unmarked side, and an operation separating the two. If one watches the third value, one ends up observing the observer drawing the distinction--an observer who, of course, may be oneself.  In this collection, more general essays study the consequences of such an understanding of form for our conceptions of literature, paradox, sign, play, and language. Other essays focus on the observations necessary to construct such forms as money, the university, the state, a career, or sickness. All the essays share an interest in problems ensuing from the fact that though one can observe the form of a distinction and become aware of its arbitrary, contingent, and discriminatory nature, one nevertheless, when trying to act or communicate, must choose a distinction. The essays show how social situations deftly veil the arbitrariness of the distinctions that constitute their forms.},

  author = {Baecker, Dirk},
  abstract = {The society of electronic and digital media produces an “overflow of meaning” (Niklas Luhmann) in relation to the structure and culture of earlier media epochs of human society. The article recalls these earlier media epochs, i.e. the epochs of orality (“tribal society”), writing (“ancient high culture”) and printing (“modern society”), to explain the theorem of an overflow of meaning and to ask about the specific meaning overflow of the society of electronic and digital media. This overflow – ‘surplus’ to some, ‘excess’ to others –is described as a control overflow, whereby the instantaneous communication of news, sound and moving images of electronic media and the memory, algorithms and programs of digital media accompany every possible communication of any content among between any participants, on the one hand, and which is responded to by humans and their social systems developing ever new ways of exploring and exploiting this control, on the other. A new structure of society distributes this overflow to different areas of society, each of which finds its own way of dealing with electronic and digital media. And a new culture of society is condensing the overflow into a recurring meaning throughout society. We are probably currently witnessing the emergence of a structure of network society and a culture of complexity, i.e. the search for new forms of synchronisation of body, consciousness, communication and technology. The article concludes with some remarks on the question of communication with machines.},

  abstract = {The landscape of social theory has changed significantly over the three decades since the publication of Anthony Giddens and Jonathan Turner’s seminal Social Theory Today. Sociologists in the twenty-first century desperately need a new agenda centered around central questions of social theory. In Social Theory Now, Claudio E. Benzecry, Monika Krause, and Isaac Ariail Reed set a new course for sociologists, bringing together contributions from the most~distinctive\,sociological\,traditions\,in an ambitious survey of where social theory is today and where it might be going.The book\,provides a strategic window onto social theory based on current research, examining trends in classical traditions and the cutting edge of more recent approaches. From distinctive theoretical positions, contributors address questions about\,how social order is accomplished; the role of materiality, practice, and meaning; as well as the conditions for the knowledge of the social world. The theoretical traditions presented include cultural sociology, microsociologies, world-system theory and post-colonial theory, gender and feminism, actor network and network theory, systems theory, field theory, rational choice, poststructuralism, pragmatism, and the sociology of conventions. Each chapter introduces a tradition and presents an agenda for further theoretical development. Social Theory Now is an essential tool for sociologists. It will be central to the discussion and teaching of contemporary social theory\,for years to come.},

  abstract = {Graphics Shaders: Theory and Practice is intended for a second course in computer graphics at the undergraduate or graduate level, introducing shader programming in general, but focusing on the GLSL shading language. While teaching how to write programmable shaders, the authors also teach and reinforce the fundamentals of computer graphics. The second edition has been updated to incorporate changes in the OpenGL API (OpenGL 4.x and GLSL 4.x0) and also has a chapter on the new tessellation shaders, including many practical examples.   The book starts with a quick review of the graphics pipeline, emphasizing features that are rarely taught in introductory courses, but are immediately exposed in shader work. It then covers shader-specific theory for vertex, tessellation, geometry, and fragment shaders using the GLSL 4.x0 shading language. The text also introduces the freely available glman tool that enables you to develop, test, and tune shaders separately from the applications that will use them. The authors explore how shaders can be used to support a wide variety of applications and present examples of shaders in 3D geometry, scientific visualization, geometry morphing, algorithmic art, and more.  Features of the Second Edition:   Written using the most recent specification releases (OpenGL 4.x and GLSL 4.x0) including code examples brought up-to-date with the current standard of the GLSL language. More examples and more exercises A chapter on tessellation shaders An expanded Serious Fun chapter with examples that illustrate using shaders to produce fun effects A discussion of how to handle the major changes occurring in the OpenGL standard, and some C++ classes to help you manage that transition   The authors thoroughly explain the concepts, use sample code to describe details of the concepts, and then challenge you to extend the examples. They provide sample source code for many of the book’s examples at www.cgeducation.org},

Gain access to Private CodePen links with working demos for all examples.---"Don’t just learn all the things CSS flexbox and grid can do for you. Instead learn all the things YOU can do with them."---Why this book?Most of the tutorials on the web teach the concepts of CSS Flexbox and Grid using some coloured blocks. You get introduced to all the CSS properties related to these concepts and how they work. But very rarely you get to see some examples of where and how these are used in the real world. Without understanding the real world application, learning is incomplete.This book takes a completely different approach. I won't teach you the things flex and grid can do. Instead, I will first show you some components and layouts and make you think how to build them using the CSS concepts you already know. Now you have a problem, and you want a solution. That's when I introduce the concepts you "need" to know.This is called Problem-Based Learning which will not only keep you motivated throughout the book, but also help you retain the knowledge far better.Who is this book for?Whether you are a beginner at CSS who's never heard of flex and grid, or someone who knows all the concepts but finding it hard to implement in real projects, or anywhere in between, this book is for you. Even if you're here to just look at some examples and practise your skills, you will find a great collection here.},

Banerjee and Esther Duflo show how economics, when done right, can help us solve the thorniest social and political problems of our day. From immigration to inequality, slowing growth to accelerating climate change, we have the resources to address the challenges we face but we are so often blinded by ideology.Original, provocative and urgent, Good Economics for Hard Times offers the new thinking that we need. It builds on cutting-edge research in economics - and years of exploring the most effective solutions to alleviate extreme poverty - to make a persuasive case for an intelligent interventionism and a society built on compassion and respect. A much-needed antidote to polarized discourse, this book shines a light to help us appreciate and understand our precariously balanced world.},

  abstract = {Language mediation is employed as a possible solution for problems of migrants' inclusion in institutional services, within multilingual and multicultural societies. Interpreting Studies has highlighted that language mediation is coordination of social interactions and social construction of narratives. This paper explains language mediation using Luhmann's theory of communication systems, in particular the concepts of self-reference, reflexivity, function, structure, and structural coupling. Language mediation is observed as a self-referential communication system fulfilling the function of promoting participation and new narratives through reflexive coordination. In particular, the concept of structural coupling explains how language mediation can enhance change within other communication systems, promoting dialogue across difference. Language mediation, however, can also assume a hierarchical structure, which creates marginalization and ethnocentrism.},

Their approach was to openly share details of microcontroller-based hardware design platforms to stimulate the sharing of ideas and promote innovation. This concept has been popular in the software world for many years. This book is intended for a wide variety of audiences including students of the fine arts, middle and senior high school students, engineering design students, and practicing scientists and engineers. To meet this wide audience, the book has been divided into sections to satisfy the need of each reader. The book contains many software and hardware examples to assist the reader in developing a wide variety of systems. For the examples, the Arduino Duemilanove and the Atmel ATmega328 is employed as the target processor.},

With examples from the paintings of Van Gogh and Picasso, the work of contemporary feminist painters, the photography of Bill Henson and the film and animation work of Van Sowerine, Estelle Barrett demonstrates how Kristeva can illuminate the relationships between artist and art object, between artists, artworks and audiences, and between art and knowledge. Through these relationships she explores what Kristeva's work reveals about the role and function of art in society and offers a smooth passage through Kristeva's ideas and her relevance to visual culture.},

For Barthes, words and objects have in common the organized capacity to say something; at the same time, since they are signs, words and objects have the bad faith always to appear natural to their consumer, as if what they say is eternal, true, necessary, instead of arbitrary, made, contingent. Mythologiesfinds Barthes revealing the fashioned systems of ideas that make it possible, for example, for 'Einstein's brain' to stand for, be the myth of, 'a genius so lacking in magic that one speaks about his thought as a functional labor analogous to the mechanical making of sausages.' Each of the little essays in this book wrenches a definition out of a common but constructed object, making the object speak its hidden, but ever-so-present, reservoir of manufactured sense."--Edward W.

  abstract = {Beyond the familiar online world that most of us inhabit lies a vast network of sites, communities and cultures where freedom is pushed to its limits. A world that is as creative and complex as it is dangerous and disturbing. A world that is much closer than you think.The Dark Net is a revelatory examination of the internet today, and of its most innovative and dangerous subcultures, stretching from secret Facebook groups to the encrypted and hidden Tor network. In it, Bartlett goes in search of the people behind the screen, meeting trolls and pornographers, drug dealers and hackers, political extremists and computer scientists, Bitcoin programmers and self-harmers, libertarians and vigilantes. Based on extensive first-hand experience, exclusive interviews and shocking documentary evidence, The Dark Net offers a startling glimpse of human nature under the conditions of freedom and anonymity, and shines a light on an enigmatic and ever-changing world.},

The whole West is contained in the burst of sadistic laughter of the American soldiers, as it is behind the construction of the Israeli wall. This is where the truth of these images lies. Truth, but not veracity. As virtual as the war itself, their specific violence adds to the specific violence of the war.In The Conspiracy of Art, Baudrillard questions the privilege attached to art by its practitioners. Art has lost all desire for illusion: feeding back endlessly into itself, it has turned its own vanishment into an art unto itself. Far from lamenting the "end of art," Baudrillard celebrates art's new function within the process of insider-trading. Spiraling from aesthetic nullity to commercial frenzy, art has become transaesthetic, like society as a whole.Conceived and edited by life-long Baudrillard collaborator Sylvère Lotringer, The Conspiracy of Art presents Baudrillard's writings on art in a complicitous dance with politics, economics, and media. Culminating with "War Porn," a scathing analysis of the spectacular images from Abu Ghraib prison as a new genre of reality TV, the book folds back on itself to question the very nature of radical thought.},

To the original selection of his writings from 1968 to 1985, this new edition adds examples of Baudrillard’s work since that time.Reviews of the First Edition“This is a good book, and the author of its selected writings, Jean Baudrillard, deserves only a share of the compliment. It is difficult to introduce a difficult author, and Mark Poster has done a brilliant job. He has selected wisely from Baudrillard’s writings. . . . More important, Poster has written what may be, pound for pound, the best introduction to a social theorist I have read. . . . Poster has somehow said everything the uninitiated needs to know before deciding to read Baudrillard.”—Contemporary Sociology“Following the lead of thinkers such as Foucault, Derrida, and Deleuze, Baudrillard engages in a task of pointing away from any traditional sociological themes. His writings demand that one turn away from convenient or customary interpretations of society and, in the process, one is forced to use his or her imagination in new ways.”—Choice“Poster’s Introduction presents what is probably as clear and intelligent an exposition of Baudrillard’s ideas as you’ll find anywhere.”—Philosophy and Literature},

Pressing Freudian and Saussurean categories into the service of a basically Marxist perspective, The System of Objects offers a cultural critique of the commodity in consumer society. Baudrillard classifies the everyday objects of the "new technical order" as functional, nonfunctional and metafunctional. He contrasts "modern" and "traditional" functional objects, subjecting home furnishing and interior design to a celebrated semiological analysis. His treatment of nonfunctional or "marginal" objects focuses on antiques and the psychology of collecting, while the metafunctional category extends to the useless, the aberrant and even the "schizofunctional." Finally, Baudrillard deals at length with the implications of credit and advertising for the commodification of everyday life.  The System of Objects is a tour de force of the materialist semiotics of the early Baudrillard, who emerges in retrospect as something of a lightning rod for all the live ideas of the day: Bataille's political economy of "expenditure" and Mauss's theory of the gift; Reisman's lonely crowd and the "technological society" of Jacques Ellul; the structuralism of Roland Barthes in The System of Fashion; Henri Lefebvre's work on the social construction of space; and last, but not least, Guy Debord's situationist critique of the spectacle.},

  abstract = {This liquid modern world of ours, like all liquids, cannot stand still and keep its shape for long. Everything keeps changing - the fashions we follow, the events that intermittently catch our attention, the things we dream of and things we fear. And we, the inhabitants of this world in flux, feel the need to adjust to its tempo by being ‘flexible' and constantly ready to change. We want to know what is going on and what is likely to happen, but what we get is an avalanche of information that threatens to overwhelm us. How are we to sift the information that really matters from the heaps of useless and irrelevant rubbish? How are we to derive meaningful messages from senseless noise? We face the daunting task of trying to distinguish the important from the insubstantial, distil the things that matter from false alarms and flashes in the pan.  Nothing escapes scrutiny so stubbornly as the ordinary things of everyday life, hiding in the light of deceptive and misleading familiarity. To turn them into objects of attention and scrutiny, they must first be torn out from that daily routine: the apparently familiar must be made strange. This is precisely what Zygmunt Bauman seeks to do in these 44 letters: each tells a story drawn from ordinary lives, but tells it in order to reveal an extraordinariness that we might otherwise overlook.Arresting, revealing, disconcerting, these snapshots of life by the most brilliant analyst of our liquid modern world will appeal to a wide readership.},

For the systematic integration of citizens and other stakeholders into the policy and public value creation process, their opinions, wishes, and complaints first need to be received. In the future, including user-generated content from social media will become a main channel for the enrichment of this information base for public administrative bodies and commercial firms. However, the sheer speed of growth of this constantly updated data pool makes manual work infeasible. The automated gathering, combination, analysis, and visualization of user-generated content from various sources and multiple languages is therefore imperative.},

  abstract = {In a penetrating account of the evolution of British intelligence gathering in India, C. A. Bayly shows how networks of Indian spies, runners and political secretaries were recruited by the British to secure information about their subjects. He also examines the social and intellectual origins of these informants, and considers how the colonial authorities interpreted and often misinterpreted the information they supplied. As Professor Bayly demonstrates, it was such misunderstandings which ultimately contributed to the failure of the British to anticipate the mutinies of 1857. He argues, however, that, even before this, India's complex systems of communication were challenging the political and intellectual dominance of the European rulers.},

  abstract = {A cultural history of the face in Western art, ranging from portraiture in painting and photography to film, theater, and mass mediaThis fascinating book presents the first cultural history and anthropology of the face across centuries, continents, and media. Ranging from funerary masks and masks in drama to the figural work of contemporary artists including Cindy Sherman and Nam June Paik, renowned art historian Hans Belting emphasizes that while the face plays a critical role in human communication, it defies attempts at visual representation.Belting divides his book into three parts: faces as masks of the self, portraiture as a constantly evolving mask in Western culture, and the fate of the face in the age of mass media. Referencing a vast array of sources, Belting's insights draw on art history, philosophy, theories of visual culture, and cognitive science. He demonstrates that Western efforts to portray the face have repeatedly failed, even with the developments of new media such as photography and film, which promise ever-greater degrees of verisimilitude. In spite of sitting at the heart of human expression, the face resists possession, and creative endeavors to capture it inevitably result in masks―hollow signifiers of the humanity they're meant to embody.From creations by Van Eyck and August Sander to works by Francis Bacon, Ingmar Bergman, and Chuck Close, Face and Mask takes a remarkable look at how, through the centuries, the physical visage has inspired and evaded artistic interpretation.},

  publisher = {The MIT Press},

  abstract = {Working at the cutting edge of live performance, an emerging generation of artists is employing digital technologies to create distinctive forms of interactive, distributed, and often deeply subjective theatrical performance. The work of these artists is not only fundamentally transforming the experience of theater, it is also reshaping the nature of human interaction with computers. In this book, Steve Benford and Gabriella Giannachi offer a new theoretical framework for understanding these experiences -- which they term mixed reality performances -- and document a series of landmark performances and installations that mix the real and the virtual, live performance and interactivity. Benford and Giannachi draw on a number of works that have been developed at the University of Nottingham's Mixed Reality Laboratory, describing collaborations with artists (most notably the group Blast Theory) that have gradually evolved a distinctive interdisciplinary approach to combining practice with research. They offer detailed and extended accounts of these works from different perspectives, including interviews with the artists and Mixed Reality Laboratory researchers. The authors develop an overarching theory to guide the study and design of mixed reality performances based on the approach of interleaved trajectories through hybrid structures of space, time, interfaces, and roles. Combinations of canonical, participant, and historic trajectories show how such performances establish complex configurations of real and virtual, local and global, factual and fictional, and personal and social.},

Harvard University Press has now undertaken to publish a significant portion of his work in definitive translation, under the general editorship of Michael W. Jennings. This volume, the first of three, will at last give readers of English a true sense of the man and the many facets of his thought. (The magnum opus of Benjamin’s Paris years, The Arcades Project, has been published in a separate volume.) Walter Benjamin emerged from the head-on collision of an idealistic youth movement and the First World War, which Benjamin and his close friends thought immoral. He walked away from the wreck scarred yet determined “to be considered as the principal critic of German literature.” But the scene, as he found it, was dominated by “talented fakes,” so―to use his words―“only a terrorist campaign would I suffice” to effect radical change. This book offers the record of the first phase of that campaign, culminating with “One Way Street,” one of the most significant products of the German avant-garde of the Twenties. Against conformism, homogeneity, and gentrification of all life into a new world order, Benjamin made the word his sword. Volume I of the Selected Writings brings together essays long and short, academic treatises, reviews, fragments, and privately circulated pronouncements. Fully five-sixths of this material has never before been translated into English. The contents begin in 1913, when Benjamin, as an undergraduate in imperial Germany, was president of a radical youth group, and take us through 1926, when he had already begun, with his explorations of the world of mass culture, to emerge as a critical voice in Weimar Germany’s most influential journals. The volume includes a number of his most important works, including “Two Poems by Friedrich Hölderlin,” “Goethe’s Elective Affinities,” “The Concept of Criticism in German Romanticism,” “The Task of the Translator,” and “One Way Street.” He is as compelling and insightful when musing on riddles or children’s books as he is when dealing with weightier issues such as the philosophy of language, symbolic logic, or epistemology. We meet Benjamin the youthful idealist, the sober moralist, the political theorist, the experimentalist, the translator, and, above all, the virtual king of criticism, with his magisterial exposition of the basic problems of aesthetics. Benjamin’s sentences provoke us to return to them again and again, luring us as though with the promise of some final revelation that is always being postponed. He is by turns fierce and tender, melancholy and ebullient; he is at once classically rooted, even archaic, in his explorations of the human psyche and the world of things, and strikingly progressive in his attitude toward society and what he likes to call the organs of the collective (its architectures, fashions, signboards). Throughout, he displays a far-sighted urgency, judging the present on the basis of possible futures. And he is gifted with a keen sense of humor. Mysterious though he may sometimes be (his Latvian love, Asia Lacis, once described him as a visitor from another planet), Benjamin remains perhaps the most consistently surprising and challenging of critical writers.},

  abstract = {"Every line we succeed in publishing today...is a victory wrested from the powers of darkness." So wrote Walter Benjamin in January 1940. Not long afterward, he himself would fall prey to those powers, a victim of suicide following a failed attempt to flee the Nazis. However insistently the idea of catastrophe hangs over Benjamin's writings in the final years of his life, the "victories wrested" in this period nonetheless constitute some of the most remarkable twentieth-century analyses of the emergence of modern society. The essays on Charles Baudelaire are the distillation of a lifetime of thinking about the nature of modernity. They record the crisis of meaning experienced by a civilization sliding into the abyss, even as they testify to Benjamin's own faith in the written word.This volume ranges from studies of Baudelaire, Brecht, and the historian Carl Jochmann to appraisals of photography, film, and poetry. At their core is the question of how art can survive and thrive in a tumultuous time. Here we see Benjamin laying out an ethic for the critic and artist--a subdued but resilient heroism. At the same time, he was setting forth a sociohistorical account of how art adapts in an age of violence and repression. Working at the height of his powers to the very end, Benjamin refined his theory of the mass media that culminated in the final version of his essay "The Work of Art in the Age of Its Technological Reproducibility." Also included in this volume is his influential piece "On the Concept of History," completed just before his death. The book is remarkable for its inquiry into the nature of "the modern" (especially as revealed in Baudelaire), for its ideas about the transmogrification of art and the radical discontinuities of history, and for its examples of humane life and thought in the midst of barbarism. The entire collection is eloquent testimony to the indomitable spirit of humanity under siege.},

  abstract = {Radical critic of a European civilization plunging into darkness, yet commemorator of the humane traditions of the old bourgeoisie--such was Walter Benjamin in the later 1930s. This volume, the third in a four-volume set, offers twenty-seven brilliant pieces, nineteen of which have never before been translated.The centerpiece, A Berlin Childhood around 1900, marks the first appearance in English of one of the greatest German works of the twentieth century: a profound and beautiful account of the vanished world of Benjamin's privileged boyhood, recollected in exile. No less remarkable are the previously untranslated second version of Benjamin's most famous essay, "The Work of Art in the Age of Its Technological Reproducibility," with its striking insights into the relations between technology and aesthetics, and German Men and Women, a book in which Benjamin collects twenty-six letters by distinguished Germans from 1783 to 1883 in an effort to preserve what he called the true humanity of German tradition from the debasement of fascism.Volume 3 also offers extensively annotated translations of essays that are key to Benjamin's rewriting of the story of modernism and modernity--such as "The Storyteller" and "Paris, the Capital of the Nineteenth Century"--as well as a fascinating diary from 1938 and penetrating studies of Bertolt Brecht, Franz Kafka, and Eduard Fuchs. A narrative chronology details Benjamin's life during these four harrowing years of his exile in France and Denmark. This is an essential collection for anyone interested in his work.},

  abstract = {Benjamin’s famous “Work of Art” essay sets out his boldest thoughts—on media and on culture in general—in their most realized form, while retaining an edge that gets under the skin of everyone who reads it. In this essay the visual arts of the machine age morph into literature and theory and then back again to images, gestures, and thought. This essay, however, is only the beginning of a vast collection of writings that the editors have assembled to demonstrate what was revolutionary about Benjamin’s explorations on media. Long before Marshall McLuhan, Benjamin saw that the way a bullet rips into its victim is exactly the way a movie or pop song lodges in the soul.This book contains the second, and most daring, of the four versions of the “Work of Art” essay—the one that addresses the utopian developments of the modern media. The collection tracks Benjamin’s observations on the media as they are revealed in essays on the production and reception of art; on film, radio, and photography; and on the modern transformations of literature and painting. The volume contains some of Benjamin’s best-known work alongside fascinating, little-known essays—some appearing for the first time in English. In the context of his passionate engagement with questions of aesthetics, the scope of Benjamin’s media theory can be fully appreciated.},

Sociologists in the twenty-first century desperately need a new agenda centered around central questions of social theory. In Social Theory Now, Claudio E. Benzecry, Monika Krause, and Isaac Ariail Reed set a new course for sociologists, bringing together contributions from the most~distinctive\,sociological\,traditions\,in an ambitious survey of where social theory is today and where it might be going.The book\,provides a strategic window onto social theory based on current research, examining trends in classical traditions and the cutting edge of more recent approaches. From distinctive theoretical positions, contributors address questions about\,how social order is accomplished; the role of materiality, practice, and meaning; as well as the conditions for the knowledge of the social world. The theoretical traditions presented include cultural sociology, microsociologies, world-system theory and post-colonial theory, gender and feminism, actor network and network theory, systems theory, field theory, rational choice, poststructuralism, pragmatism, and the sociology of conventions. Each chapter introduces a tradition and presents an agenda for further theoretical development. Social Theory Now is an essential tool for sociologists. It will be central to the discussion and teaching of contemporary social theory\,for years to come.},

  abstract = {It has long been thought that the ancient Greeks did not take mechanics seriously as part of the workings of nature, and that therefore their natural philosophy was both primitive and marginal. In this book Sylvia Berryman challenges that assumption, arguing that the idea that the world works 'like a machine' can be found in ancient Greek thought, predating the early modern philosophy with which it is most closely associated. Her discussion ranges over topics including balancing and equilibrium, lifting water, sphere-making and models of the heavens, and ancient Greek pneumatic theory, with detailed analysis of thinkers such as Aristotle, Archimedes, and Hero of Alexandria. Her book shows scholars of ancient Greek philosophy why it is necessary to pay attention to mechanics, and shows historians of science why the differences between ancient and modern reactions to mechanics are not as great as was generally thought.},

  abstract = {This paper, outlines a groundwork for a media theory of machine learning by introducing two new concepts, compute-computing and compute-computed, and a framework for their interaction. Compute-computing (computing as generative) is here understood as the “active” learning component of a system, whereas compute-computed (computing as generated) is understood as the “passive”, coded, imprinted or inscribed aspect of a system. I introduce these two concepts to help us to think through the specificity of algorithmic systems that are more than just the operative, sequential or parallel systems of computational processing to which we have become accustomed. Indeed, in the case of machine learning systems, these systems have the capacity to be self-positing in the sense of generating models and data structures that internalise certain pattern characteristics of data, without the requirement that they are translated into formal data structures by a human programmer. That is, they are able to capture the abstract form of data input into the system, identify key characteristics, frames or patterns, and store this for comparison and classification of other data streams or objects.},

Through a close analysis of the early videoblogging community and their creative practices, she argues that early in the new millennium a new cultural-technical media hybrid emerged. This coalesced around the short-form digital film whose aesthetic, technical form and content is a predecessor to, and anticipator of our current media ecology. Trine Bjørkmann Berry is a visiting researcher at the University of Sussex. She publishes on online video, digital culture and aesthetics. Her new research examines the history and practices of the video essay.},

While in the room, the artist engaged in symbolist gestures, such as striking a triangle and tossing his gloves to the coyote. At the end of the three days, the coyote, who had become quite tolerant of Beuys, allowed a hug from the artist, who was transported back to the airport via ambulance. He never set foot on outside American soil nor saw anything of America other than the coyote and the inside of the gallery.},

Computer vision is one of today's most exciting application fields of machine learning, with Deep Learning driving innovative systems such as self-driving cars and Google's DeepMind.OpenCV lies at the intersection of these topics, providing a comprehensive open-source library for classic as well as state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning algorithms. In combination with Python Anaconda, you will have access to all the open-source computing libraries you could possibly ask for.Machine learning for OpenCV begins by introducing you to the essential concepts of statistical learning, such as classification and regression. Once all the basics are covered, you will start exploring various algorithms such as decision trees, support vector machines, and Bayesian networks, and learn how to combine them with other OpenCV functionality. As the book progresses, so will your machine learning skills, until you are ready to take on today's hottest topic in the field: Deep Learning.By the end of this book, you will be ready to take on your own machine learning problems, either by building on the existing source code or developing your own algorithm from scratch!Style and approachOpenCV machine learning connects the fundamental theoretical principles behind machine learning to their practical applications in a way that focuses on asking and answering the right questions. This book walks you through the key elements of OpenCV and its powerful machine learning classes, while demonstrating how to get to grips with a range of models.},

Readers are expected to be familiar with OpenCV's concepts and Python libraries. Basic knowledge of Python programming is expected and assumed. What You Will Learn * Generate real-time visual effects using different filters and image manipulation techniques such as dodging and burning * Recognize hand gestures in real time and perform hand-shape analysis based on the output of a Microsoft Kinect sensor * Learn feature extraction and feature matching for tracking arbitrary objects of interest * Reconstruct a 3D real-world scene from 2D camera motion and common camera reprojection techniques * Track visually salient objects by searching for and focusing on important regions of an image * Detect faces using a cascade classifier and recognize emotional expressions in human faces using multi-layer peceptrons (MLPs) * Recognize street signs using a multi-class adaptation of support vector machines (SVMs) * Strengthen your OpenCV2 skills and learn how to use new OpenCV3 features In Detail OpenCV is a native cross platform C++ Library for computer vision, machine learning, and image processing. It is increasingly being adopted in Python for development. OpenCV has C++/C, Python, and Java interfaces with support for Windows, Linux, Mac, iOS, and Android. Developers using OpenCV build applications to process visual data; this can include live streaming data from a device like a camera, such as photographs or videos. OpenCV offers extensive libraries with over 500 functions This book demonstrates how to develop a series of intermediate to advanced projects using OpenCV and Python, rather than teaching the core concepts of OpenCV in theoretical lessons. Instead, the working projects developed in this book teach the reader how to apply their theoretical knowledge to topics such as image manipulation, augmented reality, object tracking, 3D scene reconstruction, statistical learning, and object categorization. By the end of this book, readers will be OpenCV experts whose newly gained experience allows them to develop their own advanced computer vision applications.

Whether you're an art school grad looking for a gallery, a mid-career artist managing a busy studio, or someone just thinking about becoming a professional artist, this indispensable resource will help you build your career and protect yourself along the way.   Unlike other creative professionals, visual artists don't have agents or managers. You have to do it all yourself, at least until you find gallery representation -- and even then, there are important business and legal issues you need to understand to stay in control of your career and ensure you're being treated fairly. Heather Darcy Bhandari, a gallery director, and Jonathan Melber, an arts lawyer, walk you through these issues so that you can essentially act as your own manager and agent. They show you, for example, how to tackle business basics such as tracking inventory and preparing invoices; how to take legal precautions like registering a copyright and drafting consignment forms; how to use promotional tools like websites and business cards; and how to approach career decisions such as choosing the right venue to show your work.   In addition to drawing on their own experiences, Bhandari and Melber interviewed nearly one hundred curators, dealers, and other arts professionals, in cities across the country, about what they expect from and look for in artists. The authors also talked to a host of artists about their careers and the lessons they've learned navigating the art world. The book is full of their entertaining anecdotes and candid advice.   No matter what kind of artist you are -- or want to be -- this book will help you. Art/Work covers everything you need to know to succeed, saving you from having to learn it all the hard way -- and letting you spend more time making art.},

In addition, Marga Bijvoet argues, the nature of inquiry of these art works requires a 'field' interpratation, which perceives art as a set of relations in context. She suggests that this 'movement' might eventually bear the seed for a new paradigm of the visual arts.},

The conflict between objective and subjective ways of understanding information corresponds to the conflict between an understanding of information as a thing or a substance versus an understanding of it as a sign. It is a fundamental distinction that involves a whole theory of knowledge, and it has roots back to different metaphors applied in Shannon's information theory. It is argued that a subject-dependent/situation specific understanding of information is best suited to fulfill the needs in information science and that it is urgent for us to base Information Science (IS; or Library and Information Science, LIS) on this alternative theoretical frame.},

  publisher = {Verso Books},
  abstract = {Since the 1990s, critics and curators have broadly accepted the notion that participatory art is the ultimate political art: that by encouraging an audience to take part an artist can promote new emancipatory social relations. Around the world, the champions of this form of expression are numerous, ranging from art historians such as Grant Kester, curators such as Nicolas Bourriaud and Nato Thompson, to performance theorists such as Shannon Jackson.Artificial Hells is the first historical and theoretical overview of socially engaged participatory art, known in the US as “social practice.” Claire Bishop follows the trajectory of twentieth-century art and examines key moments in the development of a participatory aesthetic. This itinerary takes in Futurism and Dada; the Situationist International; Happenings in Eastern Europe, Argentina and Paris; the 1970s Community Arts Movement; and the Artists Placement Group. It concludes with a discussion of long-term educational projects by contemporary artists such as Thomas Hirschhorn, Tania Bruguera, Pawe? Althamer and Paul Chan.Since her controversial essay in Artforum in 2006, Claire Bishop has been one of the few to challenge the political and aesthetic ambitions of participatory art. In Artificial Hells, she not only scrutinizes the emancipatory claims made for these projects, but also provides an alternative to the ethical (rather than artistic) criteria invited by such artworks. Artificial Hells calls for a less prescriptive approach to art and politics, and for more compelling, troubling and bolder forms of participatory art and criticism.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present a complete system for automatic face replacement in images. Our system uses a large library of face images created automatically by downloading images from the internet, extracting faces using face detection software, and aligning each extracted face to a common coordinate system. This library is constructed off-line, once, and can be efficiently accessed during face replacement. Our replacement algorithm has three main stages. First, given an input image, we detect all faces that are present, align them to the coordinate system used by our face library, and select candidate face images from our face library that are similar to the input face in appearance and pose. Second, we adjust the pose, lighting, and color of the candidate face images to match the appearance of those in the input image, and seamlessly blend in the results. Third, we rank the blended candidate replacements by computing a match distance over the overlap region. Our approach requires no 3D model, is fully automatic, and generates highly plausible results across a wide range of skin tones, lighting conditions, and viewpoints. We show how our approach can be used for a variety of applications including face de-identification and the creation of appealing group photographs from a set of images. We conclude with a user study that validates the high quality of our replacement results, and a discussion on the current limitations of our system.},

  abstract = {Abstract             This book argues that there is a joint in nature between seeing and thinking, perception, and cognition. Perception is constitutively iconic, nonconceptual, and nonpropositional, whereas cognition does not have these properties constitutively. The book does not appeal to “intuitions,” as is common in philosophy, but to empirical evidence, including experiments in neuroscience and psychology. The book argues that cognition affects perception, i.e., that perception is cognitively penetrable, but that this does not impugn the joint in nature. A key part of the argument is that we perceive not only low-level properties like colors, shapes, and textures but also high-level properties such as faces and causation. Along the way, the book explains the difference between perception and perceptual memory, the differences between format and content, and whether perception is probabilistic despite our lack of awareness of probabilistic properties. The book argues for perceptual categories that are not concepts, that perception need not be singular, that perceptual attribution and perceptual discrimination are equally fundamental, and that basic features of the mind known as “core cognition” are not a third category in between perception and cognition. The chapter on consciousness leverages these results to argue against some of the most widely accepted theories of consciousness. Although only one chapter is about consciousness, much of the rest of the book repurposes work on consciousness to isolate the scientific basis of perception.},

The main goal of this collaboration was to create artistic displays, experiments and videos to engage a large public with fundamental physics. Beyond its public success, this “SupraDesign” project enabled an encounter between two communities: researchers in physics and designers. The collaboration revealed unexpected similarities in working methods, such as testing through experimentation, engaging in teamwork and making use of creativity in a constraining environment.},

In a series of essays, Margaret Boden, a philosopher and expert in artificial intelligence, and Ernest Edmonds, a pioneering and internationally recognized computer artist, grapple with key questions about the aesthetics of computer art. Other modern technologies—photography and film—have been accepted by critics as ways of doing art. Does the use of computers compromise computer art's aesthetic credentials in ways that the use of cameras does not?~Is writing a computer program equivalent to painting with a brush?Essays by Boden identify types of computer art, describe the study of creativity in AI, and explore links between computer art and traditional views in philosophical aesthetics. Essays by Edmonds offer a practitioner's perspective, considering, among other things, how the experience of creating computer art compares to that of traditional art making. Finally, the book presents interviews in which contemporary computer artists offer a wide range of comments on the issues raised in Boden's and Edmonds's essays.},

  abstract = {Walter Benjamin is best known for his essay ‘The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction’, (Benjamin, 1968b) in which he argues that film and other mechanical technologies are destroying the aura that had belonged to traditional art. In this article we apply Benjamin’s concept of aura to new (digital) media, and in particular to ‘mixed reality’, a group of technologies that blend computer-generated visual, aural, and textual information into the user’s physical environment. We argue that mixed reality increases the options for designer-artists and apparently allows the invocation of aura in new ways. Our culture’s pursuit of auratic experience remains problematic in mixed reality as it was for Benjamin in the case of film. New media maintain aura in a permanent state of oscillation or crisis, and this crisis is a key to understanding new media.},

Barbara Bolt takes the most relevant of his texts, including his most famous work, Being and Time, and sets out ways of thinking about art in a post-medium, digital, technocratic, and post-human age. She does so through the frame of works by international artists, including Sophie Calle, Anish Kapoor, and Anselm Keifer. A glossary of terms completes this full and clear~companion to Heidegger.},

  abstract = {No judgement of taste is innocent. In a word, we are all snobs. Pierre Bourdieu brilliantly illuminates this situation of the middle class in the modern world. France's leading sociologist focusses here on the French bourgeoisie, its tastes and preferences. Distinction is at once a vast ethnography of contemporary France and a dissection of the bourgeois mind.In the course of everyday life people constantly choose between what they find aesthetically pleasing and what they consider tacky, merely trendy, or ugly. Bourdicu bases his study on surveys that took into account the multitude of social factors that play a part in a Frenchperson's choice of clothing, furniture, leisure activities, dinner menus for guests, and many other matters of taste. What emerges from his analysis is that social snobbery is everywhere in the bourgeois world. The different aesthetic choices people make are all distinctions-that is, choices made in opposition to those made by other classes. Taste is not pure. Bourdieu finds a world of social meaning in the decision to order bouillabaisse, in our contemporary cult of thinness, in the "California sports" such as jogging and cross-country skiing. The social world, he argues, functions simultaneously as a system of power relations and as a symbolic system in which minute distinctions of taste become the basis for social judgement.The topic of Bourdieu's book is a fascinating one: the strategies of social pretension are always curiously engaging. But the book is more than fascinating. It is a major contribution to current debates on the theory of culture and a challenge to the major theoretical schools in contemporary sociology.},

Yet, despite the influence of his work, no single introduction to his wide-ranging oeuvre is available. This book, intended for an English-speaking audience, offers a systematic and accessible overview, providing interpretive keys to the internal logic of Bourdieu's work by explicating thematic and methodological principles underlying his work. The structure of Bourdieu's theory of knowledge, practice, and society is first dissected by Loic Wacquant; he then collaborates with Bourdieu in a dialogue in which they discuss central concepts of Bourdieu's work, confront the main objections and criticisms his work has met, and outline Bourdieu's views of the relation of sociology to philosophy, economics, history, and politics. The final section captures Bourdieu in action in the seminar room as he addresses the topic of how to practice the craft of reflexive sociology. Throughout, they stress Bourdieu's emphasis on reflexivity\&\#8212;his inclusion of a theory of intellectual practice as an integral component of a theory of society\&\#8212;and on method\&\#8212;particularly his manner of posing problems that permits a transfer of knowledge from one area of inquiry into another. Amplified by notes and an extensive bibliography, this synthetic view is essential reading for both students and advanced scholars.},

Of course, if you are wondering whether this book is going to teach you how to create amazing applets or incredible desktop or mobile applications, the answer is "no"-that is a job for other books. So many books out there can teach you those skills in Python, C\#, or Java. Many of them even claim that they can teach you in 24 hours! Don't laugh! They probably can do that, but all of them take one thing for granted-that the reader knows some basics about computer programming. None of those books, unfortunately, bothers to teach you the first thing that a novice programmer needs to learn, which is "Algorithmic Thinking." Algorithmic Thinking involves more than just learning code. It is a problem solving process that involves learning how to code. With over 700 pages, and containing more than 300 solved and 400 unsolved exercises, over 450 true/false, 150 multiple choice, and 180 review questions (the solutions and the answers to which can be found on the Internet), this book is ideal for students, teachers, professors, novices or average programmers, or for anyone who wants to start learning or teaching computer programming using the proper conventions and techniques.},

  abstract = {Thomas Piketty’s Capital in the Twenty-First Century is the most widely discussed work of economics in recent history, selling millions of copies in dozens of languages. But are its analyses of inequality and economic growth on target? Where should researchers go from here in exploring the ideas Piketty pushed to the forefront of global conversation? A cast of economists and other social scientists tackle these questions in dialogue with Piketty, in what is sure to be a much-debated book in its own right.After Piketty opens with a discussion by Arthur Goldhammer, the book’s translator, of the reasons for Capital’s phenomenal success, followed by the published reviews of Nobel laureates Paul Krugman and Robert Solow. The rest of the book is devoted to newly commissioned essays that interrogate Piketty’s arguments. Suresh Naidu and other contributors ask whether Piketty said enough about power, slavery, and the complex nature of capital. Laura Tyson and Michael Spence consider the impact of technology on inequality. Heather Boushey, Branko Milanovic, and others consider topics ranging from gender to trends in the global South. Emmanuel Saez lays out an agenda for future research on inequality, while a variety of essayists examine the book’s implications for the social sciences more broadly. Piketty replies to these questions in a substantial concluding chapter.An indispensable interdisciplinary work, After Piketty does not shy away from the seemingly intractable problems that made Capital in the Twenty-First Century so compelling for so many.},

She also defines the term "content" and what role "content" plays in advertisers' work and advertising's place in society. Additionally, boyd discusses fake news, the long-standing place of manipulation in media and advertising, and the challenges of circulating information in a digital age. She covers the importance of collaborating across disciplinary boundaries to grapple with today's complex problems. To conclude the interview, boyd advises students to press against challenges and find mentors who cultivate learning and growth. She recommends that advertisers produce "content" that is of social value. She also reminds advertisers to follow business practices that create authentic social value for those working in the industry as well as those who are impacted by the industry's work.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

It comprises a diverse array of essays divided into four sections:~Indigenous Animacies, Atmospheric Animations, Animacy Hierarchies and Sensational Animisms. Cassandra Barnett discusses artists Terri Te Tau and Bridget Reweti and how personhood and hau (life breath) traverse art-taonga. Artist Natalie Robertson addresses kōrero (talk) with ancestors through photography. Janine Randerson and sound artist Rachel Shearer consider the sun as animate with mauri (life force), while Anna Gibb explores life in the algorithm. Rebecca Schneider and Amelia Jones discuss animacy in queered and raced formations. Stephen Zepke explores Deleuze and Guattari's animist hylozoism and Amelia Barikin examines a mineral ontology of art. This book will appeal to readers interested in indigenous and non-indigenous entanglements and those who seek different approaches to new materialism, the post-human and the anthropocene.},

Together, how do these distort and deform modern political geographies and produce new territories in their own image?In  The Stack, Benjamin Bratton proposes that these different genres of computation -- smart grids, cloud platforms, mobile apps, smart cities, the Internet of Things, automation -- can be seen not as so many species evolving on their own, but as forming a coherent whole: an accidental megastructure called The Stack that is both a computational apparatus and a new governing architecture. We are inside The Stack and it is inside of us.~In an account that is both theoretical and technical, drawing on political philosophy, architectural theory, and software studies, Bratton explores six layers of The Stack:  Earth,  Cloud,  City,  Address,  Interface,  User. Each is mapped on its own terms and understood as a component within the larger whole built from hard and soft systems intermingling -- not only computational forms but also social, human, and physical forces. This model, informed by the logic of the multilayered structure of protocol "stacks," in which network technologies operate within a modular and vertical order, offers a comprehensive image of our emerging infrastructure and a platform for its ongoing reinvention.~ The Stack is an interdisciplinary design brief for a new geopolitics that works with and for planetary-scale computation. Interweaving the continental, urban, and perceptual scales, it shows how we can better build, dwell within, communicate with, and govern our worlds.thestack.org},

The backbone of this process, the final and most important step, is known as digital compositing. The Art and Science of Digital Compositing is a comprehensive reference that provides a complete overview of the technical and the artistic nature of this process. This book covers a wide range of topics from basic image creation, representation, and manipulation, to a look at the visual cues that are necessary to create a believable composite. Designed as both an introduction to the field as well as a valuable technical reference, this book should be of interest to both novices and professionals alike.   Written by a working professional in the visual effects industry, the book provides over 250 different images and illustrations (including a 40-page color insert) as well as a complete glossary of compositing and visual-effects terminology.  Also included are in-depth case studies from well-known films such as Speed, Independence Day, and Titanic.

  abstract = {An investigation of artists' engagement with technical systems, tracing art historical lineages that connect works of different periods."Machine art" is neither a movement nor a genre, but encompasses diverse ways in which artists engage with technical systems. In this book, Andreas Broeckmann examines a variety of twentieth- and early twenty-first-century artworks that articulate people's relationships with machines. In the course of his investigation, Broeckmann traces historical lineages that connect art of different periods, looking for continuities that link works from the end of the century to developments in the 1950s and 1960s and to works by avant-garde artists in the 1910s and 1920s. An art historical perspective, he argues, might change our views of recent works that seem to be driven by new media technologies but that in fact continue a century-old artistic exploration.Broeckmann investigates critical aspects of machine aesthetics that characterized machine art until the 1960s and then turns to specific domains of artistic engagement with technology: algorithms and machine autonomy, looking in particular at the work of the Canadian artist David Rokeby; vision and image, and the advent of technical imaging; and the human body, using the work of the Australian artist Stelarc as an entry point to art that couples the machine to the body, mechanically or cybernetically. Finally, Broeckmann argues that systems thinking and ecology have brought about a fundamental shift in the meaning of technology, which has brought with it a rethinking of human subjectivity. He examines a range of artworks, including those by the Japanese artist Seiko Mikami, whose work exemplifies the shift.},

In this book, Stephen Eric Bronner provides sketches of leading representatives of the critical tradition (such as George Lukács and Ernst Bloch, Theodor Adorno and Walter Benjamin, Herbert Marcuse and Jurgen Habermas) as well as many of its seminal texts and empirical investigations. This Very Short Introduction sheds light on the cluster of concepts and themes that set critical theory apart from its more traditional philosophical competitors. Bronner explains and discusses concepts such as method and agency, alienation and reification, the culture industry and repressive tolerance, non-identity and utopia. He argues for the introduction of new categories and perspectives for illuminating the obstacles to progressive change and focusing upon hidden transformative possibilities. Only a critique of critical theory can render it salient for a new age. That is precisely what this very short introduction provides.},

  abstract = {For decades, the idea that more education will lead to greater individual and national prosperity has been a cornerstone of developed economies. Indeed, it is almost universally believed that college diplomas give Americans and Europeans a competitive advantage in the global knowledge wars.Challenging this conventional wisdom, The Global Auction forces us to reconsider our deeply held and mistaken views about how the global economy really works and how to thrive in it. Drawing on cutting-edge research based on a major international study, the authors show that the competition for good, middle-class jobs is now a worldwide competition--an auction for cut-priced brainpower--fueled by an explosion of higher education across the world. They highlight a fundamental power shift in favor of corporate bosses and emerging economies such as China and India, a change that is driving the new global high-skill, low-wage workforce. Fighting for a dwindling supply of good jobs will compel the middle classes to devote more time, money, and effort to set themselves apart in a bare-knuckle competition that will leave many disappointed. The authors urge a new conversation about the kind of society we want to live in and about the kind of global economy that can benefit workers, but without condemning millions in emerging economies to a life of poverty. The Global Auction is a radical rethinking of the ideas that stand at the heart of the American Dream. It offers a timely exposé of the realities of the global struggle for middle class jobs, a competition that threatens the livelihoods of millions of American and European workers and their families."A brilliant new book." - Andrew Reinbach, The Huffington Post"This is a very important book.  Their critique of the present state of global capitalism is both timely and convincing." - Roger Brown, Times Higher Education"[A]truly outstanding volume."-Lois Weis, University of Buffalo, British Journal of Sociology of Education."The Global Auction is a must-read for parents, college students, and policymakers. We press the message to our children: 'Study. Get degrees. Get a good job. And you will live the good life.' But such claims are strikingly at odds with the realities of income stagnation and poor job prospects. The authors explain how this dramatic breakdown between rhetoric and reality happened and how we might reconstruct an alternative future in which education becomes meaningful and fulfilling in its own right." -Henry M. Levin, Columbia University"This is a challenging and very timely book. The gauntlet is thrown down to economists wedded to human capital theory and to sociologists who see education as the great engine of social mobility." -John Goldthorpe, University of Oxford "The Global Auction deals with one of the most pressing issues of our times: how the significant expansion in the labor supply available to multinational corporations is leading to dramatic shifts in the location of employment around the world.  It draws on years of in-depth research, offering valuable insights for both academics and business leaders."-David Finegold, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey"Brown, Lauder, and Ashton's book is brilliantly argued and provides a wakeup call to global citizens everywhere. There is no substitute for the regulation of global capitalism in the interests of the many rather than the few, and this book slams the door on the last set of excuses for maintaining the current system-that somehow the educated will escape the race to the bottom."-Kevin Leicht, University of Iowa},

  abstract = {Technological optimism, even utopianism, was widespread at midcentury; in Britain, Harold Wilson in 1963 promised a new nation "forged from the white heat of the technological revolution." In this heady atmosphere, pioneering artists transformed the cold logic of computing into a new medium for their art, and played a central role in connecting technology and culture.  White Heat Cold Logic tells the story of these early British digital and computer artists -- and fills in a missing chapter in contemporary art history.In this heroic period of computer art, artists were required to build their own machines, collaborate closely with computer scientists, and learn difficult computer languages.  White Heat Cold Logic's chapters, many written by computer art pioneers themselves, describe the influence of cybernetics, with its emphasis on process and interactivity; the connections to the constructivist movement; and the importance of work done in such different venues as commercial animation, fine art schools, and polytechnics.The advent of personal computing and graphical user interfaces in 1980 signaled the end of an era, and today we do not have so many dreams of technological utopia. And yet our highly technologized and mediated world owes much to these early practitioners, especially for expanding our sense of what we can do with new technologies.ContributorsRoy Ascott, Stephen Bell, Paul Brown, Stephen Bury, Harold Cohen, Ernest Edmonds, María Fernández, Simon Ford, John Hamilton Frazer, Jeremy Gardiner, Charlie Gere, Adrian Glew, Beryl Graham, Stan Hayward, Grisham Howard, Richard Ihnatowicz, Nicholas Lambert, Malcolm Le Grice, Tony Longson, Brent MacGregor, George Mallen, Catherine Mason, Jasia Reichardt, Stephen A.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Does digital media use support or undermine psychological well-being? This question has not only elicited a lot of attention in the popular media, but it also has been investigated empirically in scientific literature. Much of these studies have been conducted in samples of adolescents and adults, reporting both positive and negative effects of digital media use on well-being, leading to at least four theoretical positions about this relationship. In each of these theories the relationship between digital media use and well-being is explained by people's social network. In the present study, we address the question whether digital media use is related to psychological well-being in a large sample ({$<$}em{$>$}N{$<$}/em{$>$}\,=\,13,871) of children aged 9–12 year. The results revealed rather weak linear relationships ({$<$}em{$>$}r{$<$}/em{$>$}'s\,\&lt;\,0.10), but at the same time it has been shown that highest frequency users of digital media in terms of daily use had a relative risk of 2.0 and beyond to score lower on well-being. In the specific group of children who have a Facebook profile ({$<$}em{$>$}N{$<$}/em{$>$}\,=\,2,528, 18.2\%), their offline social network was a much stronger predictor of well-being compared to their online social network. Based on these cross sectional results, it is concluded that heavy use of digital media by young children has an adverse impact on their psychological well-being, but that mild use of such media has very limited effects in this respect.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

Those tweets have been utilized for building machine learning classifiers able to automatically classify new tweets. Results show that a support vector machine achieves the best results with about 60\% accuracy on the multi-classification problem. This classifier has been used as a basis for constructing a decision support tool where emotional trends are visualized. To evaluate the tool, it has been successfully integrated with a pan-European alerting system, and demonstrated as part of a crisis management concept during a public event involving relevant stakeholders.},

  abstract = {Walter Benjamin's magnum opus was a book he did not live to write. In The Dialectics of Seeing, Susan Buck-Morss offers an inventive reconstruction of the Passagen Werk, or Arcades Project, as it might have taken form. Working with Benjamin's vast files of citations and commentary which contain a myriad of historical details from the dawn of consumer culture, Buck-Morss makes visible the conceptual structure that gives these fragments philosophical coherence. She uses images throughout the book to demonstrate that Benjamin took the debris of mass culture seriously as the source of philosophical truth. The Paris Arcades that so fascinated Benjamin (as they did the Surrealists whose "materialist metaphysics" he admired) were the prototype, the 19th century "ur-form" of the modern shopping mall. Benjamin's dialectics of seeing demonstrate how to read these consumer dream houses and so many other material objects of the time—from air balloons to women's fashions, from Baudelaire's poetry to Grandville's cartoons—as anticipations of social utopia and, simultaneously, as clues for a radical political critique. Buck-Morss plots Benjamin's intellectual orientation on axes running east and west, north and south—Moscow Paris, Berlin-Naples—and shows how such thinking in coordinates can explain his understanding of "dialectics at a standstill." She argues for the continuing relevance of Benjamin's insights but then allows a set of "afterimages" to have the last word.},

  abstract = {The conflict between Palestine and Israel is one of the most highly publicized and bitter struggles of modern times, a dangerous tinderbox always poised to set the Middle East aflame--and to draw the United States into the fire. In this accessible and stimulating Very Short Introduction, Martin Bunton illuminates the history of the problem, reducing it to its very essence. Adopting a fresh and original approach, Bunton explores the Palestinian-Israeli dispute in twenty-year segments, to highlight the historical complexity of the conflict throughout successive decades. Each chapter starts with an examination of the relationships among people and events that marked particular years as historical stepping stones in the evolution of the conflict, including the 1897 Basle Congress, the 1917 Balfour Declaration and British occupation of Palestine, and the 1947 UN Partition Plan and the war for Palestine. Providing a clear and fair exploration of the main issues, Bunton explores not only the historical basis of the conflict, but also looks at how and why partition has been so difficult and how efforts to restore peace continue today.About the Series: Oxford's Very Short Introductions series offers concise and original introductions to a wide range of subjects--from Islam to Sociology, Politics to Classics, Literary Theory to History, and Archaeology to the Bible. Not simply a textbook of definitions, each volume in this series provides trenchant and provocative--yet always balanced and complete--discussions of the central issues in a given discipline or field. Every Very Short Introduction gives a readable evolution of the subject in question, demonstrating how the subject has developed and how it has influenced society. Eventually, the series will encompass every major academic discipline, offering all students an accessible and abundant reference library. Whatever the area of study that one deems important or appealing, whatever the topic that fascinates the general reader, the Very Short Introductions series has a handy and affordable guide that will likely prove indispensable.},

  abstract = {Influential writings by the legendary art critic and theorist Jack Burnham―a pioneer in new media systems aesthetics and an early advocate of conceptualism. Jack Burnham is one of the few critics and theorists alive today who can claim to have radically altered the way we think about works of art. Burnham's use of the term "system" (borrowed from theoretical biology) in his 1968 essay "System Aesthetics" announced the relational character of conceptual art and newer research-based projects. Trained as an art historian, Burnham was also a sculptor. His first book, Beyond Modern Sculpture (1968), established him as a leading commentator on art and technology. A postformalist pioneer, an influential figure in new media art history, an early champion of conceptual and ecological art, and the curator of the first exhibition of digital art, Burnham is long overdue for reevaluation. This book offers that opportunity by collecting a substantial and varied selection of his hard-to-find texts, some published here for the first time. Although Burnham left the art world abruptly in the 1990s, his visionary theoretical ideas have only become more relevant in recent years. This collection seeks to restore Burnham to his rightful place in art criticism and theory, reestablishing his voice as crucial to critical conversations of the period. It gathers his early writing on sculpture, his essays on systems art and conceptualism, his views of the New York art world, and his later occult work―including an unorthodox interpretation of Marcel Duchamp's work that draws on the Kabbalah.},

  month = nov,
  publisher = {Harvard University Press},
  address = {Cambridge, Massachusetts},
  abstract = {Judith Butler elucidates the dynamics of public assembly under prevailing economic and political conditions, analyzing what they signify and how. Understanding assemblies as plural forms of performative action, Butler extends her theory of performativity to argue that precarity―the destruction of the conditions of livability―has been a galvanizing force and theme in today’s highly visible protests.Butler broadens the theory of performativity beyond speech acts to include the concerted actions of the body. Assemblies of physical bodies have an expressive dimension that cannot be reduced to speech, for the very fact of people gathering “says” something without always relying on speech. Drawing on Hannah Arendt’s view of action, yet revising her claims about the role of the body in politics, Butler asserts that embodied ways of coming together, including forms of long-distance solidarity, imply a new understanding of the public space of appearance essential to politics.Butler links assembly with precarity by pointing out that a body suffering under conditions of precarity still persists and resists, and that mobilization brings out this dual dimension of corporeal life. Just as assemblies make visible and audible the bodies that require basic freedoms of movement and association, so do they expose coercive practices in prison, the dismantling of social democracy, and the continuing demand for establishing subjugated lives as mattering, as equally worthy of life. By enacting a form of radical solidarity in opposition to political and economic forces, a new sense of “the people” emerges, interdependent, grievable, precarious, and persistent.},

  author = {Butler, Judith},
  year = 2015,
  month = mar,
  edition = {1 edition},
  publisher = {Fordham University Press},
  abstract = {This book brings together a group of Judith Butler’s philosophical essays written over two decades that elaborate her reflections on the roles of the passions in subject formation through an engagement with Hegel, Kierkegaard, Descartes, Spinoza, Malebranche, Merleau-Ponty, Freud, Irigaray, and Fanon. Drawing on her early work on Hegelian desire and her subsequent reflections on the psychic life of power and the possibility of self-narration, this book considers how passions such as desire, rage, love, and grief are bound up with becoming a subject within specific historical fields of power.Butler shows in different philosophical contexts how the self that seeks to make itself finds itself already affected and formed against its will by social and discursive powers. And yet, agency and action are not necessarily nullified by this primary impingement. Primary sense impressions register this dual situation of being acted on and acting, countering the idea that acting requires one to overcome the situation of being affected by others and the linguistic and social world. This dual structure of sense sheds light on the desire to live, the practice and peril of grieving, embodied resistance, love, and modes of enthrallment and dispossession. Working with theories of embodiment, desire, and relationality in conversation with philosophers as diverse as Hegel, Spinoza, Descartes, Merleau-Ponty, Freud, and Fanon, Butler reanimates and revises her basic propositions concerning the constitution and deconstitution of the subject within fields of power, taking up key issues of gender, sexuality, and race in several analyses. Taken together, these essays track the development of Butler’s embodied account of ethical relations.},

It uses the Processing language (processing.org) to visualise the concepts through the production of computer graphics that illustrate the coding principles while being artworks in their own right. This book started as a set of tutorials for university level multimedia students to introduce them to computer programming through the development of artworks. It’s therefore presented in a non-threatening way that will ease the reader into programming.  This book has been written for absolute beginners who want to learn to program. It approaches coding through a unique combination of teaching programming while keeping in mind the principles of design and mathematics. All these elements are essential in a global economy filled with electronic interactive experiences and virtual reality.  The chapters are organised to weave together programming functionality and design principles presenting one concept at a time, with multiple hands on exercises in each chapter.  Special features include:  * 10 chapters building on each other one concept at a time. * 20 practical laboratories for exploring digital art and programming concepts. * Over 35 detailed step by step hands on activities. * Over 95 questions to test your understanding. * Answers to all exercises and questions.

Besides being important for the advancement of AI, emotion processing is also important for the closely related task of polarity detection. The opportunity to automatically capture the general public's sentiments about social events, political movements, marketing campaigns, and product preferences has raised interest in both the scientific community, for the exciting open challenges, and the business world, for the remarkable fallouts in marketing and financial market prediction. This has led to the emerging fields of affective computing and sentiment analysis, which leverage human-computer interaction, information retrieval, and multimodal signal processing for distilling people's sentiments from the ever-growing amount of online social data.},

Opinion mining for product positioning, in fact, is getting a more and more popular research field but the extraction of useful information from social media is not a simple task. In this work we merge AI and Semantic Web techniques to extract, encode and represent this unstructured information. In particular, we use Sentic Computing, a multi-disciplinary approach to opinion mining and sentiment analysis, to semantically and affectively analyze text and encode results in a semantic aware format according to different web ontologies. Eventually we represent this information as an interconnected knowledge base which is browsable through a multi-faceted classification website.},

With this practical guide, you’ll go behind the scenes to see how and why manufacturers are now designing LED devices to light everything from homes and offices to streets and warehouses. Author Sal Cangeloso shows you the working parts of a “simple” LED bulb and explains the challenges electronics companies face as they push LED lighting into the mainstream. You’ll learn how you can use LEDs now, and why solid state lighting will bring dramatic changes in the near future.  Explore the drivers, phosphors, and integrated circuits in a typical LED bulb Understand the challenges in producing LED bulbs with acceptable brightness, color temperature, and power consumption Learn about non-bulb LED applications, including lamps, street lights, and signage Discover the market forces driving—and impeding—the adoption of LED lighting Compare LEDs to compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) and electron-stimulated luminescence (ESL) bulbs Gaze into the future of intelligent lighting, including networked lighting systems},

The author has devised a system for diagramming every single logical transition that Hegel makes, many of which have never before been explored in English. This reveals a startling organizational subtlety in Hegel's work which heretofore has gone unnoticed. In the course of charting Hegel's logical progress, the author provides a vigorous defence and thorough explication of unparalleled scale and scope. The book covers the entire range of subjects connected with The Science of Logic such as Being, Essence, Measure, Subjectivity and God, showing how Hegel used logic to make transitions from one category to the next. The book also mediates Hegel's confrontation with Kant, whose Critique of Pure Reason is Hegel's major competition in metaphysical systemization. Any student encountering The Science of Logic, perhaps the most difficult and by far the most rewarding of Hegel's philosophical works, will find in Carlson's book an invaluable companion to their study.},

  abstract = {Corporate liberation is not a strategy. It is a business philosophy that leaders around the world are using to radically transform their organizations. Liberating leaders believe that a workplace based on respect and freedom is a more natural environment than one based on mistrust and control. So they acted to align their organizations with these beliefs: They liberated people's initiative and potential and with it, unshackled their companies’ performance.A lot has happened since Freedom, Inc. first appeared in 2009. The book itself has been translated to six other languages. In France, it won the best business book award and was the No.1 business/management bestseller on Amazon.fr seven months in a row. More importantly, it has inspired hundreds of leaders to launch their own corporate liberation. The French daily Le Monde has heralded the start of a corporate liberation movement in France. Since then, the phenomenon has made the cover of leading periodicals, been shown on the evening news of major European TV chains, and been the subject of a 90-minute TV documentary that broke all the records for popularity.Most liberated companies have been small and medium size—though some have grown tremendously since. Yet increasingly, multinationals such as Michelin or Decathlon—operating in Europe, America and Asia—are joining the corporate liberation movement that pioneers such as W.L. Gore and USAA began.Corporate liberation has no frontiers, geographical or industrial. Vineet Nayar has liberated an Indian high-tech giant and David Marquet, a U.S. nuclear submarine. Leaders of organizations of all sizes and types are shedding their hierarchies and bureaucracies and transforming them into respect- and freedom-based workplaces. Every morning their employees go to work, but many prefer to say they go to have fun—pursuing a common dream using their own initiative.},

Drawing on the writings of Giorgio Agamben, Alain Badiou and Martin Heidegger, alongside the dramas of Beckett, Genet and Shakespeare, and the theatre of Kantor, Foreman, Societas Raffaelo Sanzio and the Wooster Group, the book positions theatre and performance in technoculture and articulates the processes of aesthetics, metaphysics and politics. The wide-ranging study reflects on how the theatre and performance have been challenged and extended within these new cultural phenomena, and asks the question that if contemporary technoculture operates under the regime of embeddedness that seeks to infect information from within while colonizing the body through science and technology, and if the new site of the struggle for sovereignty within bio-political systems is the bare life of the individual, how can theatre produce an effective response?},

  abstract = {To remain unconsumed by consumer society—this was the goal, pursued through a world of subtle and practical means, that beckoned throughout the first volume of The Practice of Everyday Life. The second volume of the work delves even deeper than did the first into the subtle tactics of resistance and private practices that make living a subversive art. Michel de Certeau, Luce Giard, and Pierre Mayol develop a social history of “making do” based on microhistories that move from the private sphere (of dwelling, cooking, and homemaking) to the public (the experience of living in a neighborhood). A series of interviews—mostly with women—allows us to follow the subjects’ individual routines, composed of the habits, constraints, and inventive strategies by which the speakers negotiate daily life. Through these accounts the speakers, “ordinary” people all, are revealed to be anything but passive consumers. Amid these experiences and voices, the ephemeral inventions of the “obscure heroes” of the everyday, we watch the art of making do become the art of living.This long-awaited second volume of de Certeau’s masterwork, updated and revised in this first English edition, completes the picture begun in volume 1, drawing to the last detail the collective practices that define the texture, substance, and importance of the everyday.Michel de Certeau (1925-1986) wrote numerous books that have been translated into English, including Heterologies (1986), The Capture of Speech (1998), and Culture in the Plural (1998), all published by Minnesota. Luce Giard is senior researcher at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique and is affiliated with the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales, Paris. She is visiting professor of history and history of science at the University of California, San Diego. Pierre Mayol is a researcher in the French Ministry of Culture in Paris.Timothy J.

By looking at re-occurring issues in the design, playtesting and interface of serious games and game-based learning for cultural heritage and interactive history, this book highlights the importance of visualisation and self-learning in game studies and how this can intersect with digital humanities. It also asks whether such theoretical concepts can be applied to practical learning situations. It will be of particular interest to those who wish to investigate how games and virtual environments can be used in teaching and research to critique issues and topics in the humanities, particularly in virtual heritage and interactive history.},

Although we typically have the notion that our eyes record the world around us much like a camcorder or a camera, it turns out that is not the case! This chapter provides a clear and concise discussion of how human visual processing is truly the “art” of seeing. Our brain “constructs” the visual world around us in a complex way. This chapter steps through aspects of visual processing from understanding how neurons—brain cells—encode features in visual scenes to how faces are processed in a special way and finally to what happens when visual areas in the brain are damaged. A fascinating aspect of vision—visual illusion—is presented with an explanation of why the brain is “fooled” by these illusions. The chapter ends with a discussion of the conscious—and unconscious—perception of visual objects. Key Words: Visual cortex, retina, striate cortex, face perception, object recognition, visual illusions, multistable perception, blindsight, binocular rivalry, consciousness in the brain},

  abstract = {"Who exactly are the 'intellectuals'? This term is so widely used today that we forget that it is a recent invention, dating from the late nineteenth century. In Birth of the Intellectuals, the renowned historian and sociologist Christophe Charle shows that the term 'intellectuals' first appeared at the time of the Dreyfus Affair, and the neologism originally signified a cultural and political vanguard who dared to challenge the status quo. Yet the word, expected to disappear once the political crisis had dissolved, has somehow endured. At times it describes a social group, and at others a way of seeing the social world from the perspective of universal values that challenges established hierarchies. But why did intellectuals survive when the events that gave rise to this term had faded into the past? To answer this question, it is necessary to show how the crisis of the old representations, the unprecedented expansion of the intellectual professions and the vacuum left by the decline of the traditional ruling class created favourable conditions for the collective affirmation of 'intellectuals.' This also explains why the literary or academic avant garde traditionally reluctant to engage gradually reconciled themselves with political activists and developed new ways to intervene in the field of power outside of traditional political channels. Through a careful rereading of the petitions surrounding the Dreyfus Affair, Charle offers a radical reinterpretation of this crucial moment of European history and develops a new model for understanding the ways in which public intellectuals in France, Germany, Britain, and the United States have addressed politics ever since"--From publisher's website},

Sensing intimacy in performance relocates registers of affect from the private experience to the public sphere. Within the current climate of intense global political, social and financial insecurity and unrest, at a time infused with both hope and fear, artists appear to be demonstrating a desire for intimacy and closeness with the Other. Those public figurings of intimacy – staged through contemporary performance, visual culture and digital art practices – become the cultural fuel which, when placed alongside political potentialities, can ignite debates and provocations such as those contained herein.},

  abstract = {Electrical networks, flocking birds, transportation hubs, weather patterns, commercial organisations, swarming robots... Increasingly, many of the systems that we want to engineer or understand are said to be ‘complex’. These systems are often considered to be intractable because of their unpredictability, non-linearity, interconnectivity, heterarchy and ‘emergence’. Such attributes are often framed as a problem, but can also be exploited to encourage systems to efficiently exhibit intelligent, robust, self-organising behaviours. But what does it mean to describe systems as complex? How do these complex systems differ from the more easily understood ‘modular’ systems that we are familiar with? What are the underlying similarities between different systems, whether modular or complex? Answering these questions is a first step in approaching the design and science of complexity. However, to do so, it is necessary to look beyond the specifics of any particular system or field of study. We need to consider the fundamental nature of systems, looking for a common way to view ostensibly different phenomena.  This primer introduces a domain-neutral framework and diagrammatic scheme for characterising the ways in which systems are modular or complex. Rather than seeing modularity and complexity as inherent attributes of systems, we instead see them as ways in which those systems are characterised by those who are interested in them. The framework is not tied to any established mode of representation (e.g. networks, equations, formal modelling languages) nor to any domain-specific terminology (e.g. ‘vertex’, ‘eigenvector’, ‘entropy’). Instead, it consists of basic system constructs and three fundamental attributes of modular system architecture, namely structural encapsulation, function-structure mapping and interfacing. These constructs and attributes encourage more precise descriptions of different aspects of complexity (e.g. emergence, self-organisation, heterarchy). This allows researchers and practitioners from different disciplines to share methods, theories and findings related to the design and study of different systems, even when those systems appear superficially dissimilar.},

  abstract = {Visual sentiment analysis is getting increasing attention because of the rapidly growing amount of images in online social interactions and several emerging applications such as online propaganda and advertisement. Recent studies have shown promising progress in analyzing visual affect concepts intended by the media content publisher. In contrast, this paper focuses on predicting what viewer affect concepts will be triggered when the image is perceived by the viewers. For example, given an image tagged with "yummy food," the viewers are likely to comment "delicious" and "hungry," which we refer to as viewer affect concepts (VAC) in this paper. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work explicitly distinguishing intended publisher affect concepts and induced viewer affect concepts associated with social visual content, and aiming at understanding their correlations. We present around 400 VACs automatically mined from million-scale real user comments associated with images in social media. Furthermore, we propose an automatic visual based approach to predict VACs by first detecting publisher affect concepts in image content and then applying statistical correlations between such publisher affect concepts and the VACs. We demonstrate major benefits of the proposed methods in several real-world tasks - recommending images to invoke certain target VACs among viewers, increasing the accuracy of predicting VACs by 20.1\% and finally developing a social assistant tool that may suggest plausible, content-specific and desirable comments when users view new images.},

The last three are the ones that need tackling at the disciplinary level. The author broadly defines information visualization as visual representations of the semantics, or meaning, of information. In contrast to scientific visualization, information visualization typically deals with nonnumeric, nonspatial, and high-dimensional data.},

Arguing that both Marx and the post-structuralists seek to produce a genuinely materialist philosophy, the author aims to develop a better understanding of both Marx and post-structuralism and in so doing to reflect on the possibilities and problems for materialist philosophy more broadly. Against the common assumption that post-structuralism begins with a rejection of Marx, Choat argues that Marx has been a key influence on post-structuralist thought and that each of the four thinkers examined affirms Marxs contemporary significance. By looking at how these thinkers have read Marx analysing their direct comments, unspoken uses, and implicit criticisms the book demonstrates that there is a distinct and original post-structuralist approach to Marx that allows us to read him in a new light.},

This CNA found that the Performance Improvement Quarterly network showed more widely but loosely connected and less centralized structural attributes than the human resource development network; the 10 most influential articles in the field were identified; frequently co-cited articles were recognized as having a strong relationship by subsequent researchers; and five cohesive subgroups showed key topics in the field (performance, instructional design, performance support, organization/workplace, and transfer of training). Implications from the results of the CNA were elaborated on for future research in HPT.},

The first six chapters, originally published in the 1960s, made a groundbreaking contribution to linguistic theory. This edition complements them with an additional chapter and a new preface, bringing Chomsky's influential approach into the twenty-first century. Chapters 1-6 present Chomsky's early work on the nature and acquisition of language as a genetically endowed, biological system (Universal Grammar), through the rules and principles of which we acquire an internalized knowledge (I-language). Over the past fifty years, this framework has sparked an explosion of inquiry into a wide range of languages, and has yielded some major theoretical questions. The final chapter revisits the key issues, reviewing the 'biolinguistic' approach that has guided Chomsky's work from its origins to the present day, and raising some novel and exciting challenges for the study of language and mind.},

  abstract = {Visual representations of human suffering never simply speak of humanity. Rather, they speak within specific political, institutional, and technological contexts in order to make 'universal' claims to truth and ethics. And they are produced, circulated, and interpreted by organizations, groups, and individuals increasingly rapidly across different contexts in our digital era. Whether shown and seen as photographs, displayed on analogue and digital screens, or experienced in the aesthetic form of artworks, memorials and monuments, the visual is used to produce responses to human rights violations and humanitarian crises – to register, record, archive and 'bear witness'. As such, visualizations of suffering are invariably caught up in the politics of what it is to count as human, or not, what it is to witness, and what it is to respond in the name of humanity. It is this complicity among the visual, interpretation, and humanity, between the aesthetics and ethics of various mediations of human suffering as a cause for public action that is the focus of this special issue. Like traditional forms of visuality such as painting, prints, or sculpture, today's media representations of human suffering, in photography, film, television or digital platforms, make assertions regarding 'truth' and 'art' – to depicting reality as-it-is and to specific aesthetic tropes that testify to human trauma. This interpenetration of truth and art in the mediated visualities of suffering has, in the past half century, mobilized debates about the epistemological and ethico-political status of such images and initiated controversies around their social implications across a number of fields such as war photojournalism, public memorialization practices, and humanitarian and human rights advocacy. An important agenda was set by Sontag's early work ({$<$}a href="\#"{$>$}1977{$<$}/a{$>$}), which resulted in debates on compassion fatigue ({$<$}a href="\#"{$>$}Moeller, 1999{$<$}/a{$>$}), de-sensitization ({$<$}a href="\#"{$>$}Peters, 1999{$<$}/a{$>$}; {$<$}a href="\#"{$>$}Robbins, 1994{$<$}/a{$>$}), and over-mediation ({$<$}a href="\#"{$>$}Keenan, 2012{$<$}/a{$>$}). Despite revisions, many scholars remain deeply suspicious of the effects of an ethics of witnessing on the moralization of Western publics. By contrast, in response to the pessimistic accounts of the relationship between visuality and ethics, other scholars, including Sontag in her later work, emphasize the capacity of mediated representations to humanize distant suffering ({$<$}a href="\#"{$>$}Linfield, 2010{$<$}/a{$>$}; {$<$}a href="\#"{$>$}Sontag, 2003{$<$}/a{$>$}), to mobilize public opinion and imagination ({$<$}a href="\#"{$>$}Hariman and Loucaites, 2007{$<$}/a{$>$}; {$<$}a href="\#"{$>$}Sliwinski, 2011{$<$}/a{$>$}), and to propose symbolic spaces of empathetic connectivity and solidarity ({$<$}a href="\#"{$>$}Chouliaraki, 2006{$<$}/a{$>$}; {$<$}a href="\#"{$>$}Silverstone, 2007{$<$}/a{$>$}). The aim of this special issue is neither to revive nor take sides in these debates. It is to take them as a starting point to follow a somewhat different path: to explore the contemporary conditions of possibility that make certain images and visualizations of humanity possible while disallowing others; and to investigate the implication of those that are seen in the contexts of humanitarianism and human rights as ongoing projects that engage both transnational solidarity and global power. It is not that humanitarianism and human rights are the same; they have different histories, and different legal and moral logics ({$<$}a href="\#"{$>$}Barnett, 2011{$<$}/a{$>$}). But the field-specific practices of humanitarianism and human rights do overlap insofar as organizations situated in these fields are oriented towards gaining political, moral, and financial support through mediated publics. Also of concern are the legal and ethical frameworks within which human rights violations are addressed, the political contexts in which judicial measures are promulgated, and the role of aesthetic mediations in those interactions. From within distinct but overlapping fields, humanitarianism and human rights organizations, and the news media that broadly sustain their values share common moral and aesthetic concerns with making images of suffering matter. In the course of this exploration, this special issue draws on work from a range of methodological approaches and academic disciplines, from Communication Studies to Sociology and History of Art, so as to investigate the two key concepts of these debates: visual aesthetics and humanity. The articles have been selected for two main reasons. First, they complicate existing accounts of the nature and transformations of visuality in the 21st century by examining how images circulate and function in symbolic, technological, and institutional practices. Second, they problematize the operations of 'humanity' as an aesthetic, legal, and political category that is used to legitimate projects of local, national, and transnational solidarity, and of global power.

  abstract = {Critical texts that span almost fifty years, mapping Haacke's progression from engagement with biological systems to interrogation of the social and economic underpinnings of art.For five decades, the artist Hans Haacke (b. 1936) has created works that explore the social, political, and economic underpinnings of the production of art. His works make plain the hidden and not-so-hidden agendas of those -- from Cartier to David Koch -- who support art in the service of industry; they expose such inconvenient social and economic truths as the real estate holdings of Manhattan slumlords, and the attempts to whitewash support for the Nazi regime, apartheid, or the war on terror through museum donations. This book gathers interviews, difficult-to-find essays, cornerstones of institutional critique, and new critical approaches by writers that include Benjamin H. D. Buchloh, Jack Burnham, Rosalyn Deutsche, and Leo Steinberg. Haacke's 1971 Guggenheim exhibition was famously canceled when the artist refused to withdraw several proposed works, including one exposing the business dealings of a Manhattan real estate company. This volume includes Edward Fry's catalog text for that show, as well as Walter Grasskamp's "An Unpublished Text for an Unpainted Picture," redacted from an exhibition catalog in 1984 because of statements about the German collector Peter Ludwig. Other essays consider such topics as Haacke's controversial commission for the Reichstag; the activation of the spectator, from  Condensation Cube to the Polls; the conceptual continuity of his practice with regard to General Systems Theory; and his delayed and problematic reception in both the United States and Europe. With contemporary essays and scholarly reassessments, this collection serves as an essential guide to critical thinking on Haacke's artistic practice, from the works of the 1960s that engage with physical and biological systems to his later interrogations of the social and economic underpinnings of art.ContributorsYve-Alain Bois, Benjamin H.

New media generate new metamorphs.New stories have emerged from cybernetic displacements of life, sensation, or intelligence from human beings to machines. But beyond the vogue for the cyborg and the cybernetic mash-up of the organic and the mechanical, Posthuman Metamorphosis develops neocybernetic systems theories illuminating alternative narratives that elicit autopoietic and symbiotic visions of the posthuman.Systems theory also transforms our modes of narrative cognition. Regarding narrative in the light of the autopoietic systems it brings into play, neocybernetics brings narrative theory into constructive relation with the systemic operations of observation, communication, and paradox.Posthuman Metamorphosis draws on Bruno Latour, Donna Haraway, Niklas Luhmann, Cary Wolfe, Mieke Bal, Katherine Hayles, Friedrich Kittler, and Lynn Margulis to read narratives of bodily metamorphosis as allegories of the contingencies of systems. Tracing the posthuman intuitions of both pre- and post-cybernetic metamorphs, it demonstrates the viability of second-order systems theories for narrative theory, media theory, cultural science studies, and literary criticism.},

  abstract = {From the Publisher: Public interest in biblical archaeology is at an all-time high, as television documentaries pull in millions of viewers to watch shows on the Exodus, the Ark of the Covenant, and the so-called Lost Tomb of Jesus. Important discoveries with relevance to the Bible are made virtually every year-during 2007 and 2008 alone researchers announced at least seven major discoveries in Israel, five of them in or near Jerusalem. Biblical Archaeology offers a passport into this fascinating realm, where ancient religion and modern science meet, and where tomorrow's discovery may answer a riddle that has lasted a thousand years. Archaeologist Eric H. Cline here offers a complete overview of this exciting field. He discusses the early pioneers, such as Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie and William Foxwell Albright, the origins of biblical archaeology as a discipline, and the major controversies that first prompted explorers to go in search of objects and sites that would "prove" the Bible. He then surveys some of the most well-known biblical archaeologists, including Kathleen Kenyon and Yigael Yadin, the sites that are essential sources of knowledge for biblical archaeology, such as Hazor, Megiddo, Gezer, Lachish, Masada, and Jerusalem, and some of the most important discoveries that have been made, including the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Mesha Inscription, and the Tel Dan Stele. Subsequent chapters examine additional archaeological finds that shed further light on the Hebrew Bible and New Testament, the issue of potential frauds and forgeries, including the James Ossuary and the Jehoash Tablet, and future prospects of the field. Biblical Archaeology: A Very Short Introduction captures the sense of excitement and importance that surrounds not only the past history of the field but also the present and the future, with fascinating new discoveries made each and every season},

In this paper the author puts forward instances where ideology is held in common across cultural borders. A general awareness of facets of shared ideology has been refined, extended and given substance through three curatorial projects involving Dr. Te Huirangi Waikerepuru, a highly respected kaumatua (elder). These took place in Istanbul, Albuquerque and Aotearoa New Zealand. Ethically, acceptance of these commonalities leads to considering the shifting boundary of knowledge in contemporary life.},

  abstract = {Future users of large data banks must be protected from having to know how the data is organized in the machine (the internal representation). A prompting service which supplies such information is not a satisfactory solution. Activities of users at terminals and most application programs should remain unaffected when the internal representation of data is changed and even when some aspects of the external representation are changed. Changes in data representation will often be needed as a result of changes in query, update, and report traffic and natural growth in the types of stored information. Existing noninferential, formatted data systems provide users with tree-structured files or slightly more general network models of the data. In Section 1, inadequacies of these models are discussed. A model based on n-ary relations, a normal form for data base relations, and the concept of a universal data sublanguage are introduced. In Section 2, certain operations on relations (other than logical inference) are discussed and applied to the problems of redundancy and consistency in the user's model.},

This year’s conference theme of art.science.balance also creates an opening for discussion between the two disciplines. This paper contributes to this discussion by presenting some challenges to dialogue between interactive art and HCI. I then illustrate by way of example affinities between the two disciplines. I conclude by pointing out that it is the challenges to dialogue which can potentially yield the most interesting results.},

  abstract = {Mapping the possibilities of photofilmic imagesThis book explores the multifarious ways in which art, cinema, and other forms of visual culture respond to a digitized and networked world. Traditional discourses on medium specificity, developed in distinct disciplines, often fail to provide an adequate description of the transformations that photography and film have undergone. The essays, written by internationally renowned scholars, encompass a broad range of different forms such as video, documentary film, cinema, photography, and the Internet, as well as varied fields such as art history, film studies, photography theory, visual culture studies, and media theory. In this way they deal with heterogeneous practices or techniques ranging from panoramas, drone surveillance, tableau vivant, press coverage, computer-based editing, digitized financial markets, and various concepts such as temporality and contemporaneity, eco-aesthetics and forensic practice, countervisuality, human rights and political imagination, social transparency and control, thus charting the possibilities of the continuous border-crossing movement between photographic and filmic images within contemporary art and visual culture. This volume also contains, as an artist’s contribution, a substantial and richly illustrated interview with Eric Baudelaire.Contributors:Eric Baudelaire (Paris), Brianne Cohen (Amherst College), Stefanie Diekmann (University of Hildesheim), Evgenia Giannouri (Paris 3 Sorbonne Nouvelle), Lilian Haberer (University of Cologne), Jana J.

This history is made up of long periods of ignorance and confusion, punctuated once an age by a brilliant thinker who puts it all together. These few tower over the ordinary mass of people, and in the traditional account, it is to them that we owe science in its entirety. This belief is wrong. A People's History of Science shows how ordinary people participate in creating science and have done so throughout history. It documents how the development of science has affected ordinary people, and how ordinary people perceived that development. It would be wrong to claim that the formulation of quantum theory or the structure of DNA can be credited directly to artisans or peasants, but if modern science is likened to a skyscraper, then those twentieth-century triumphs are the sophisticated filigrees at its pinnacle that are supported by the massive foundation created by the rest of us.},

The contents are very clear, it is easy to follow and the concepts are very solid."- Javier García Fernández (Journalist \& developer)"Teaching D3 is hard and it's been very useful to have a resource like Peter's D3 in Depth website to send students to. With this book Peter delivers something rather more substantial - a non-trivial D3 visualisation built from the ground up. You get the hard earned pro-tips and perspectives delivered in a realistic context - pretty much the gold standard for learning."- Kyran Dale (author of Data Visualization with Python and JavaScript (O'Reilly))"I’d very much recommend this book to anyone who needs to rapidly get up to speed with D3, whether they are an experienced developer or a relative novice. It will give you all the tools and knowledge to create professional grade visualisations."- Mike Hadlow (Developer \& blogger)"Being able to master the programmatic building of data visualisations is a treasured capability. Being able to elegantly explain and educate others to help develop their capability is of exceptional value. Peter is a one of those rare talents who flourishes at both: if you want to learn from one of the best, I can’t recommend Peter’s books enough."- Andy Kirk (Visualisation consultant, author, speaker \& trainer)DescriptionD3 Start to Finish teaches you how to build a custom, interactive and beautiful data visualisation using the JavaScript library D3.js (versions 6 and 7).The book covers D3 concepts such as selections, joins, requests, scale functions, event handling and transitions. It also covers general web development techniques such as state management and modularisation. In other words, everything you need to know to build a real world, custom data visualisation.You'll also learn how to put these concepts into practice by building an interactive data visualisation called Energy Explorer. This is a custom data visualisation that visualises the energy mix of 141 countries. There are 15 separate build steps and you're taken through each step in detail. There's also a code download link for all 15 steps so you can follow along.Some of the topics covered are:requesting CSV data using D3D3 data joins (including joining nested data)architecting a data visualisation using a layout functiondetailed styling using CSSadding a popup using Flourish's popup librarystate managementanimations using D3 transitionsdata manipulation using Lodashadding a menu, legend and footerTo get the most out of this book you need to be familiar with HTML, SVG, CSS and JavaScript. If you need to get up to speed with these languages I recommend my book Fundamentals of HTML, CSS, SVG \& JavaScript for Data Visualisation.},

  shorttitle = {Read My Desire},
  author = {Copjec, Joan},
  year = 1994,
  publisher = {MIT Press},
  abstract = {In Read My Desire, Joan Copjec stages a confrontation between the theories of Jacques Lacan and Michel Foucault, protagonists of two powerful modern discourses - psychoanalysis and historicism. Ordinarily, these discourses only cross paths long enough for historicists to charge psychoanalysis with an indifference to history, but here psychoanalysis, via Lacan, goes on the offensive. Refusing to cede historicity to the historicists, Copjec makes a case for the superiority of Lacan's explanation of historical process, its generative principles, and its complex functionings. Her goal is to inspire a new kind of cultural critique, one that would be "literate in desire," that would be able to read what is inarticulable in cultural statements.Choosing a variety of battlegrounds, from historical phenomena - the 40,000 unsettling photographs of Moroccan drapery taken by Lacan's mentor, G. G. de ClArambaufilm noir; the rise of democracy and questions of human rights - to theoretical concepts such as the gaze, cause, and sexual difference, Copjec imagines the blows that each contender might strike. Although Lacan emerges the victor, one has a sense that for Copjec the contest is close, that she is interested not in simply dismissing Foucault but in seizing his theory at those moments when its concerns and strategies are similar to Lacan's. She is intent on understanding how two compelling theories come to diverge, how small differences distort common assumptions.Establishing the links between psychoanalysis and critical philosophy, Copjec treats psychoanalysis not as a private language but as the mother tongue of modernity. She thus makes Lacan's famous "return to Freud" a return, as well, to the best principles of the Enlightenment. By this maneuver she forces us to question the historicist dialect that we have been taught to speak and that we all but take for granted and to regret the loss in it of psychoanalysis's more rousing accents.},

By laying bare points of convergence and divergence between artistic and scientific approaches, the article develops a number of arguments that show how the pictures produced by information visualization may be reframed within wider aesthetic and critical frameworks. Thus the author explores how models of image production derived from processes of scientific inquiry expand possibilities for the visual arts to develop new types of hybrid images that consist of data grounded both in material realities and in symbolic and aesthetic elements.},

  abstract = {Popular culture in this "biological century" seems to feed on proliferating fears, anxieties, and hopes around the life sciences at a time when such basic concepts as scientific truth, race and gender identity, and the human itself are destabilized in the public eye. Tactical Biopolitics suggests that the political challenges at the intersection of life, science, and art are best addressed through a combination of artistic intervention, critical theorizing, and reflective practices. Transcending disciplinary boundaries, contributions to this volume focus on the political significance of recent advances in the biological sciences and explore the possibility of public participation in scientific discourse, drawing on research and practice in art, biology, critical theory, anthropology, and cultural studies. After framing the subject in terms of both biology and art, Tactical Biopolitics discusses such topics as race and genetics (with contributions from leading biologists Richard Lewontin and Richard Levins); feminist bioscience; the politics of scientific expertise; bioart and the public sphere (with an essay by artist Claire Pentecost); activism and public health (with an essay by Treatment Action Group co-founder Mark Harrington); biosecurity after 9/11 (with essays by artists' collective Critical Art Ensemble and anthropologist Paul Rabinow); and human-animal interaction (with a framing essay by cultural theorist Donna Haraway).ContributorsGaymon Bennett, Larry Carbone, Karen Cardozo, Gary Cass, Beatriz da Costa, Oron Catts, Gabriella Coleman, Critical Art Ensemble, Gwen D'Arcangelis, Troy Duster, Donna Haraway, Mark Harrington, Jens Hauser, Kathy High, Fatimah Jackson, Gwyneth Jones, Jonathan King, Richard Levins, Richard Lewontin, Rachel Mayeri, Sherie McDonald, Claire Pentecost, Kavita Philip, Paul Rabinow, Banu Subramanian, subRosa, Abha Sur, Samir Sur, Jacqueline Stevens, Eugene Thacker, Paul Vanouse, Ionat Zurr Beatriz da Costa does interventionist art using computing and biotechnologies, and Kavita Philip studies colonialism, neoliberalism, and technoscience using history and critical theory.

  abstract = {The analytic philosophers writing here engage with the cluster of philosophical questions raised by conceptual art. They address four broad questions: What kind of art is conceptual art? What follows from the fact that conceptual art does not aim to have aesthetic value? What knowledge or understanding can we gain from conceptual art? How ought we to appreciate conceptual art? Conceptual art, broadly understood by the contributors as beginning with Marcel Duchamp's ready-mades and as continuing beyond the 1970s to include some of today's contemporary art, is grounded in the notion that the artist's 'idea' is central to art, and, contrary to tradition, that the material work is by no means essential to the art as such. To use the words of the conceptual artist Sol LeWitt, 'In conceptual art the idea of the concept is the most important aspect of the work . . . and the execution is a perfunctory affair'. Given this so-called 'dematerialization' of the art object, the emphasis on cognitive value, and the frequent appeal to philosophy by many conceptual artists, there are many questions that are raised by conceptual art that should be of interest to analytic philosophers. Why, then, has so little work been done in this area? This volume is most probably the first collection of papers by analytic philosophers tackling these concerns head-on.},

  abstract = {Look closely at Keith Cottingham's constructed reality. Beneath the surface of what simply appears to be photographic realism, Cottingham uses anatomical drawings, wax, digital painting, and montage to explore where the body (race, gender age) and the mind (one's sense of self) collide. As identity and perception are called into question, the images do not pulse with humanity and life force. Instead, they radiate a sterile and silent modern aura that embodies a subtle, somewhat horrifying beauty. The imaginary images in "Fictitious Portraits" depict the alienation and fragmentation of image from matter, and of soul from body. Ultimately, Cottingham challenges what is perceived as portraiture, for there were no actual models used for this series. "By destabilizing photographic representation, the series demonstrates that the self is not generated out of an internal dialogue alone. Instead, the very core of personhood is dependent upon the body. In effect, we are our race, gender, and age. Yet, because the self is fluid, and able to change, we cannot be reduced to our exterior attributes. I tease out the fluidity of identity… like a mobious strip upon which internal and external realities write the body. Flesh and soul are two sides of a coin that has circulated for so long that its humanly fabricated nature has been all but forgotten."},

  abstract = {In the 1970s, and in parallel to the increasing visibility of computer technologies in culture, the term software was employed as a cultural metaphor to indicate a shift away from an emphasis on the (hardware) object of art. In a similar way, contemporary ‘software art’ practice places emphasis on source code (as well as its execution), just as conceptual art's articulation of the 'dematerialisation' of the art object previously threw emphasis on the ideas and process of the artwork. Nowadays, technical, cultural and political processes increasingly utilise software but also can be seen to ‘act’ like software. The paper investigates this line of thinking through an engagement with systems theory, software art and culture, immaterial labour and human action - ultimately applying a theoretical framework based on a historical (im)materialist approach in order to emphasise the possibility of ‘transformative praxis’ under current conditions. Two key issues are highlighted with relevance to the ‘re:place’ conference and the purpose of historical work in general: firstly, that an analogy can be drawn between the operations of software and historical processes; and secondly (and as a consequence), a term like software art (as a contingent description of practice) should not represent a further art historical genre but more productively offer a means of breaking the continuum that much (media) art historical work seeks to establish. (* Note: The title is ironic: borrowing from John Roberts’s ‘Art has no History’, in turn based on Althusser’s ‘Ideology has no History’, that itself is a reference to Marx’s The German Ideology in which he proposes that ideology is an illusion produced by those in power, but also its sense of history is a mere reflection of 'real history' - it has no history of its own.)},

Shifting the discourse from its usual rationalistic framework, Richard Coyne shows how the conception, development, and application of computer systems is challenged and enhanced by postmodern philosophical thought. He places particular emphasis on the theory of metaphor, showing how it has more to offer than notions of method and models appropriated from science.  Coyne examines the entire range of contemporary philosophical thinking—including logical positivism, analytic philosophy, pragmatism, phenomenology, critical theory, hermeneutics, and deconstruction—comparing them and showing how they differ in their consequences for design and development issues in electronic communications, computer representation, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and multimedia. He also probes the claims made of information technology, including its presumptions of control, its so-called radicality, even its ability to make virtual worlds, and shows that many of these claims are poorly founded.  Among the writings Coyne visits are works by Heidegger, Adorno, Benjamin, Gadamer, Derrida, Habermas, Rorty, and Foucault. He relates their views to information technology designers and critics such as Herbert Simon, Alan Kay, Terry Winograd, Hubert Dreyfus, and Joseph Weizenbaum. In particular, Coyne draws extensively from the writing of Martin Heidegger, who has presented one of the most radical critiques of technology to date.},

This analysis of the historical formation of the observer is a compelling account of the prehistory of the society of the spectacle.In Techniques of the Observer Jonathan Crary provides a dramatically new perspective on the visual culture of the nineteenth century, reassessing problems of both visual modernism and social modernity.Inverting conventional approaches, Crary considers the problem of visuality not through the study of art works and images, but by analyzing the historical construction of the observer. He insists that the problems of vision are inseparable from the operation of social power and examines how, beginning in the 1820s, the observer became the site of new discourses and practices that situated vision within the body as a physiological event. Alongside the sudden appearance of physiological optics, Crary points out, theories and models of "subjective vision" were developed that gave the observer a new autonomy and productivity while simultaneously allowing new forms of control and standardization of vision.Crary examines a range of diverse work in philosophy, in the empirical sciences, and in the elements of an emerging mass visual culture. He discusses at length the significance of optical apparatuses such as the stereoscope and of precinematic devices, detailing how they were the product of new physiological knowledge. He also shows how these forms of mass culture, usually labeled as "realist," were in fact based on abstract models of vision, and he suggests that mimetic or perspectival notions of vision and representation were initially abandoned in the first half of the nineteenth century within a variety of powerful institutions and discourses, well before the modernist painting of the 1870s and 1880s.},

His work in this area, however--despite its richness in suggestive ideas--has long remained obscure and confusing to scholars. Now, Donald Crawford has answered the need for a careful and insightful exegesis, aided both scholars and students to a clearer understanding of one of Kant's most important arguments. IN these pages, Crawford provides a thorough exposition of Kant's transcendental deduction of the judgement of taste, dividing the argument into five stages, Typical in Crawford's concise illumination is his drawing of the close connection between beauty and the good in Kant's system, and the importance of this connection for justifying the element of universal obligation to agree that Kant finds to be imputed in the judgment of taste. In his analysis, Crawford traces Kant's aesthetic theory to its roots in Kant's other philosophical views (especially his epistemological thought) and he gives careful consideration to Kant as a formalist in aesthetics.},

The application accepts user-generated content, acting as a new form of generative monument to the neighborhood as it evolves.

This ground-breaking book brings these two thinkers together in a critical confrontation between these two traditions. Derridean deconstruction and Rortian pragmatism are both accused by their enemies of undermining our ideas of truth and reason, but do their ideas lead to intellectual and political chaos? Both are committed to the democratic project but they reject the necessary link between universalism, rationalism and modern democracy and seek to clarify what is at stake intellectually and politically. Two other distinguished theorists, Simon Critchley and Ernesto Laclau, provide a critical context for their debate and bring out the importance of the convergences and differences between the two.

This approach recontextualizes precisely those aspects of postmodernism which appear, superficially, to be fuel for the relativist fire. This method also enables him to illuminate some of the great practical dangers of the postmodern era - most notably the widespread inability or unwillingness to distinguish between signs and reality. Crowther renews analytic philosophy as a searching form of conceptual and cultural critique that pushes beyond the limits of postmodern thought.Essential reading for advanced students and academics interested in Twentieth Century Philosophy, Philosophy After Postmodernism will also be of value to scholars working in the fields of Cultural Studies and Sociology.},

  abstract = {Research and selection of information, as well as its display and analysis, have become central to our daily lives. They are interestingly close to the cultural techniques that preside to the production of knowledge and to art-related practices, such as curating, exhibiting and critique, which seems to bring testimony to the triumph of the so-called 'knowledge society' and 'creative economy'. But, while both scientific knowledge and cultural industry are rapidly relying on algorithms, automated analysis and data visualisation to deal with the exponential growth of data, cultural institutions and humanities are still struggling to decide in what terms are they going to enter the digital age, although they are already being transformed through the infrastructure of digital archives and digital media. This proposal will reflect upon the meaning of activities such as curating, displaying and critique, that have shaped the worlds of art and culture over the last century and upon their redefinition by the mathematics and geometry that are developping the new information geographies of the cultural economy.}

  abstract = {Light symbolises the highest good, it enables all visual art, and today it lies at the heart of billion-dollar industries. The control of light forms the foundation of contemporary vision. Digital Light brings together artists, curators, technologists and media archaeologists to study the historical evolution of digital light-based technologies. Digital Light provides a critical account of the capacities and limitations of contemporary digital light-based technologies and techniques by tracing their genealogies and comparing them with their predecessor media. As digital light remediates multiple historical forms (photography, print, film, video, projection, paint), the collection draws from all of these histories, connecting them to the digital present and placing them in dialogue with one another. Light is at once universal and deeply historical. The invention of mechanical media (including photography and cinematography) allied with changing print technologies (half-tone, lithography) helped structure the emerging electronic media of television and video, which in turn shaped the bitmap processing and raster display of digital visual media. Digital light is, as Stephen Jones points out in his contribution, an oxymoron: light is photons, particulate and discrete, and therefore always digital. But photons are also waveforms, subject to manipulation in myriad ways. From Fourier transforms to chip design, colour management to the translation of vector graphics into arithmetic displays, light is constantly disciplined to human purposes. In the form of fibre optics, light is now the infrastructure of all our media; in urban plazas and handheld devices, screens have become ubiquitous, and also standardised. This collection addresses how this occurred, what it means, and how artists, curators and engineers confront and challenge the constraints of increasingly normalised digital visual media. While various art pieces and other content are considered throughout the collection, the focus is specifically on what such pieces suggest about the intersection of technique and technology. Including accounts by prominent artists and professionals, the collection emphasises the centrality of use and experimentation in the shaping of technological platforms. Indeed, a recurring theme is how techniques of previous media become technologies, inscribed in both digital software and hardware. Contributions include considerations of image-oriented software and file formats; screen technologies; projection and urban screen surfaces; histories of computer graphics, 2D and 3D image editing software, photography and cinematic art; and transformations of light-based art resulting from the distributed architectures of the internet and the logic of the database. Digital Light brings together high profile figures in diverse but increasingly convergent fields, from academy award-winner and co-founder of Pixar, Alvy Ray Smith to feminist philosopher Cathryn Vasseleu. Digital Light will be an important book. It marks a moment in history at which we are coming to terms with a range of technological convergences that have profoundly shifted the status of image production and consumption. It maps the ways in which technologies employing light have evolved from their earliest manifestations into the somewhat multifarious, operational and highly distributed conditions of today. It collects a number of very significant, accomplished practitioners and thinkers, many of whom actively look back (historically) at how ways of working with light have altered, evolved and become tangled in other agendas, implications and dimensions. The rapid shifts in the status and role of photography – first in the move to digital photography and then to their embedded smart phone ubiquity and life on photo-sharing websites and social media, is a repeated theme that returns across many of the essays. Digital Light also deals with the way in which this shift (and others) give the image the status of data, the forms of embedded agency this entails, and the implicit interaction/intersection with dimensions beyond the ‘image’ per se, through ‘tagging’ of various sorts, algorithmic construction, and automated functions.

Nevertheless the question remains: How is art, science and technology changing in the process? Does cross-disciplinary artist-initiated collaboration function as a catalyst in this setting?

  abstract = {“Technological determinism” is predominantly employed as a critic’s term, used to dismiss certain classes of theoretical and empirical claims. Understood more productively as referring to claims that place a greater emphasis on the autonomous and social-shaping tendencies of technology, technological determinism is a valuable and prominent perspective. This article will advance our understanding of technological determinism through four contributions. First, I clarify some debates about technological determinism through an examination of the meaning of technology. Second, I parse the family of claims related to technological determinism. Third, I note that constructivist and determinist insights may each be valid given particular scope conditions, the most prominent of which is the scale of analysis. Finally, I propose a theoretical microfoundation for technological determinism—military–economic adaptationism—in which economic and military competition constrain sociotechnical evolution to deterministic paths. This theory is a special case of a general theory—sociotechnical selectionism—which can be regarded as also including (mild) constructivist theories as special cases. Greater understanding of, respect for, and engagement with technological determinism will enhance the study of technology and our ability to shape our sociotechnical systems.},

In France it is considered one of the most important works of art history to have appeared in the last twenty years. With the exception of Michel Foucault's analysis of Las Meninas, it is perhaps the first time a structuralist method such as the one developed by Claude Lé¶©-Strauss in The Way of the Masks has been thoroughly and convincingly applied to Western art.  The task Damisch has set for himself is to refute both the positivist critics, whose approach makes up the bulk of perspective studies and is based on a complete repression of Panofsky's early work, and the current pseudo-avant-gardist position (whether in the field of cinema studies or in literary criticism), which tends to disregard facts and theoretical analysis. Damisch argues that if a theoretical analysis of perspective is possible, using all the tools of structuralist semiotics, it is only possible in the context of a close look at its appearance in history, beginning with the details of the "invention" of perspective.},

Television emerged and developed along tracks that had already been laid by the established mass media of film and radio. There was scarcely a phase when everything was open, allowing creative investigation to define the medium.

Beauty then came to be regarded as a serious aesthetic crime, whereas a hundred years ago it was almost unanimously considered the supreme purpose of art. Beauty is not, and should not be, the be-all and end-all of art, but it has an important place, and is not something to be avoided. Danto draws eruditely upon the thoughts of artists and critics such as Rimbaud, Fry, Matisse, the Dadaists, Duchamp, and Greenberg, as well as on that of philosophers like Hume, Kant, and Hegel. Danto agrees with the dethroning of beauty as the essence of art, and maintains with telling examples that most art is not, in fact, beautiful. He argues, however, for the partial rehabilitation of beauty and the removal of any critical taboo against beauty. Beauty is one among the many modes through which thoughts are presented to human sensibility in art: disgust, horror, sublimity, and sexuality being among other such modes.},

  abstract = {Over a decade ago, Arthur Danto announced that art ended in the sixties. Ever since this declaration, he has been at the forefront of a radical critique of the nature of art in our time. After the End of Art presents Danto's first full-scale reformulation of his original insight, showing how, with the eclipse of abstract expressionism, art has deviated irrevocably from the narrative course that Vasari helped define for it in the Renaissance. Moreover, he leads the way to a new type of criticism that can help us understand art in a posthistorical age where, for example, an artist can produce a work in the style of Rembrandt to create a visual pun, and where traditional theories cannot explain the difference between Andy Warhol's Brillo Box and the product found in the grocery store. Here we are engaged in a series of insightful and entertaining conversations on the most relevant aesthetic and philosophical issues of art, conducted by an especially acute observer of the art scene today.Originally delivered as the prestigious Mellon Lectures on the Fine Arts, these writings cover art history, pop art, "people's art," the future role of museums, and the critical contributions of Clement Greenberg--who helped make sense of modernism for viewers over two generations ago through an aesthetics-based criticism. Tracing art history from a mimetic tradition (the idea that art was a progressively more adequate representation of reality) through the modern era of manifestos (when art was defined by the artist's philosophy), Danto shows that it wasn't until the invention of Pop art that the historical understanding of the means and ends of art was nullified. Even modernist art, which tried to break with the past by questioning the ways of producing art, hinged on a narrative.Traditional notions of aesthetics can no longer apply to contemporary art, argues Danto. Instead he focuses on a philosophy of art criticism that can deal with perhaps the most perplexing feature of contemporary art: that everything},

Danto argues that recent developments in the art world, in particular the production of works of art that cannot be told from ordinary things, make urgent the need for a new theory of art and make plain the factors such a theory can and cannot involve. In the course of constructing such a theory, he seeks to demonstrate the relationship between philosophy and art, as well as the connections that hold between art and social institutions and art history.The book distinguishes what belongs to artistic theory from what has traditionally been confused with it, namely aesthetic theory and offers as well a systematic account of metaphor, expression, and style, together with an original account of artistic representation. A wealth of examples, drawn especially from recent and contemporary art, illuminate the argument.},

No textbooks that make visible these basic properties by means of art are currently available. Artistic visualization brings these “mysterious” physical objects closer to the understanding of students and the general public and leaves physicists better able to discover new secrets of the internal structure of quarks and their properties.},

  abstract = {자료구조와 알고리즘을 활용하여 간단한 웹 검색 엔진 만들기이 책은 컴퓨터과학을 공부하거나 기술 인터뷰를 준비하는 소프트웨어 개발자를 위한 실용적인 책입니다. 자료구조와 알고리즘을 빠르게 배울 수 있도록 실용적이고 중요한 부분을 중점으로 설명합니다. 자료구조가 어떻게 동작하는지보다 어떻게 활용하는지에 초점을 맞추었습니다.~이 책은 웹 검색이라는 응용 분야에 집중합니다. 이 분야는 자료구조를 광범위하게 사용하며 자체로도 흥미롭고 중요합니다. 다른 책에서는 보기 어렵지만 기술 인터뷰에 필요한 내용입니다. 또한, 버전 관리와 유닛 테스트 같은 기본적인 소프트웨어 엔지니어링 실무 내용도 다룹니다. 장마다 배운 것을 확인할 수 있는 예제가 있고, 해답을 확인할 수 있는 자동화된 테스트도 제공합니다.~- 리스트와 맵 등의 자료구조 사용과 작동 방식 이해하기- 위키피디아 페이지를 읽고, 분석하고, 결과 데이터 트리를 탐색하는 응용 프로그램 작성하기- 코드를 분석하여 실행시간과 필요한 메모리양 예측하기- 해시 테이블과 이진 검색 트리를 사용하여 맵 인터페이스 구현하기- 크롤러로 웹 검색 엔진 구축하기이 책은 자료구조와 알고리즘에 대한 내용을 설명하기 위해 문제 풀이 형식으로 구성되어 있습니다. 14개의 실습을 통해 자바 언어에서 기본으로 제공하는 자료구조인 자바 컬렉션 프레임워크(Java Collections Framework, JCF)의 주요 클래스를 중심으로 개념을 학습하고 시간 복잡도를 분석하며 성능을 측정해 봅니다. 또한, 성능 개선에 대해서도 알려 줍니다.자료구조와 알고리즘에 대한 이해는 소프트웨어의 품질을 높이는 아주 기본적인 작업입니다. 요즘은 빅데이터와 클라우드가 있고 이미 검증된 수많은 DBMS가 있지만, 단지 활용만 해서는 원하는 품질을 얻기 힘듭니다. 내가 잘 만들고 있는지, 이미 구현된 레거시 소프트웨어의 병목은 무엇인지 분석하려면 학부 과정에서 배우는 자료구조와 알고리즘이 단단한 기본기가 되기 때문입니다. 졸업하고 나면 세부 내용은 모두 잊히겠지만, 머릿속 어딘가에는 남아 다시 떠올리게 됩니다.이 책은 한 번에 후루룩 읽기에는 꽤 압축적인 내용을 담고 있습니다. 꼭 설명해야 할 내용은 본문에서 충분히 설명하지만, 그 외 부가적인 내용은 과감하게 외부 링크를 제공합니다. 실습 과제를 먼저 제공하고 그다음 장에서 바로 필자의 해답을 제시하기 때문에 부담을 가질 필요는 없습니다. 끝까지 읽는다면 큰 도움이 된다고 확신합니다. - 옮긴이의 말 중에서},

  abstract = {Today’s design research problems are different from the past; they are more complex and call for interand multi-disciplinary work. Design faculty and doctoral students are hindered in this work by the curricular content and pedagogy of the terminal master’s degree. Students graduate from professional MFA design programs often unprepared to pose truly researchable questions, recognize multiple research paradigms and their corresponding standards, structure methodologically rigorous investigations, or even author papers longer than a few pages. These shortfalls persist in the scholarly pursuits of many design faculty and extend to the institutional adoption of alternate evaluation criteria from the research thresholds in other fields. Strengthening of the quality in doctoral research and supervision, therefore, depends to some extent on rethinking master’s study in design.},

Compositional freedom comprises forming chords from the sequences, and in multi-strand music, also in simultaneously presenting different segments of pitch-sequences. The present project coded a real-time serial music composer for automatic or interactive music performance. This Serial Keyboardist Collaborator can perform keyboard music which is impossible for a human to realize. Surprisingly, it was also useful in making more tonal music based on the same rigorous pitch-sequence generation.},

  abstract = {The Lightning Field, 1977, by the American sculptor Walter De Maria, is a work of Land Art situated in a remote area of the high desert of western New Mexico. It is comprised of 400 polished stainless steel poles installed in a grid array measuring one mile by one kilometer. The poles -- two inches in diameter and averaging 20 feet and 7½ inches in height -- are spaced 220 feet apart and have solid pointed tips that define a horizontal plane. A sculpture to be walked in as well as viewed, The Lightning Field is intended to be experienced over an extended period of time. A full experience of The Lightning Field  does not depend upon the occurrence of lightning, and visitors are encouraged to spend as much time as possible in the field, especially during sunset and sunrise. In order to provide this opportunity, Dia offers overnight visits during the months of May through October. Commissioned and maintained by Dia Art Foundation, The Lightning Field is recognized internationally as one of the late-twentieth century's most significant works of art and exemplifies Dia's commitment to the support of art projects whose nature and scale exceed the limits normally available within the traditional museum or gallery. Dia also maintains two other of De Maria's projects, both located in New York City: The Broken Kilometer, 1979, and The New York Earth Room, 1977.},

  abstract = {Journal of Visual Culture, Volume 22, Issue 2, Page 146-175, August 2023. {$<$}br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" /{$>$}This article urges a reorientation in thinking about AI art (and AI more generally), shifting from the common focus on computational ‘intelligence’ to the embodied, metabolic processing that takes place in our encounters with (moving-image) artworks produced with machine-learning algorithms. Drawing on Merleau-Ponty’s corporeal phenomenology, the article argues that spectators’ bodies act as filters, distilling visual phenomena from a range of extraperceptual facets of these works; in particular, bodies react to invisible algorithmic infrastructures, which, in the case of machine learning algorithms, also operate as filters in their own right. The collision of metabolic and computational microtemporal operations calls forth a number of embodied affects, ranging from sublime awe to disorientation, cringe, and uncanny feelings of relational and environmental entanglement. These themes are explored through the work of four contemporary artists working with AI: Ian Cheng, Refik Anadol, Jon Rafman, and Yvette Granata. In conversation with these artists, the author explores our bodily responses to AI-generated imagery in an attempt to better understand the stakes, as well as the underlying mechanisms, of the new technology’s transformation of our visual culture.},

  abstract = {When he died in 2004, Jacques Derrida left behind a vast legacy of unpublished material, much of it in the form of written lectures. With The Beast and the Sovereign, Volume 1, the University of Chicago Press inaugurates an ambitious series, edited by Geoffrey Bennington and Peggy Kamuf, translating these important works into English.~The Beast and the Sovereign, Volume 1 launches the series with Derrida’s exploration of the persistent association of bestiality or animality with sovereignty. In this seminar from 2001–2002, Derrida continues his deconstruction of the traditional determinations of the human. The beast and the sovereign are connected, he contends, because neither animals nor kings are subject to the law—the sovereign stands above it, while the beast falls outside the law from below. He then traces this association through an astonishing array of texts, including La Fontaine’s fable “The Wolf and the Lamb,” Hobbes’s biblical sea monster in Leviathan, D. H. Lawrence’s poem “Snake,” Machiavelli’s Prince with its elaborate comparison of princes and foxes, a historical account of Louis XIV attending an elephant autopsy, and Rousseau’s evocation of werewolves in The Social Contract.~Deleuze, Lacan, and Agamben also come into critical play as Derrida focuses in on questions of force, right, justice, and philosophical interpretations of the limits between man and animal.},

It represents his first important statement on Marx and his definitive entry into social and political philosophy. "Specter" is the first noun one reads in The Manifesto of the Communist Party. But that's just the beginning. Once you start to notice them, there is no counting all the ghosts, spirits, specters and spooks that crowd Marx's text. If they are to count for something, however, one must question the spectropoetics that Marx allowed to invade his discourse. In Specters of Marx, Derrida undertakes this task within the context of a critique of the new dogmatism and "new world order" that have proclaimed the death of Marxism and of Marx.},

As the outbreak of COVID-19 causes by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) progresses within China and beyond, rapidly available epidemiological data are needed to guide strategies for situational awareness and intervention. The recent outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, China, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 emphasizes the importance of analyzing the epidemiological data of this novel virus and predicting their risks of infecting people all around the globe. In this study, we present an effort to compile and analyze epidemiological outbreak information on COVID-19 based on the several open datasets on 2019-nCoV provided by the Johns Hopkins University, World Health Organization, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, National Health Commission, and DXY. An exploratory data analysis with visualizations has been made to understand the number of different cases reported (confirmed, death, and recovered) in different provinces of China and outside of China. Overall, at the outset of an outbreak like this, it is highly important to readily provide information to begin the evaluation necessary to understand the risks and begin containment activities.},

  abstract = {An exploration of infographics and data visualization as a cultural phenomenon, from eighteenth-century print culture to today's data journalism.Infographics and data visualization are ubiquitous in our everyday media diet, particularly in news—in print newspapers, on television news, and online. It has been argued that infographics are changing what it means to be literate in the twenty-first century—and even that they harmonize uniquely with human cognition. In this first serious exploration of the subject, Murray Dick traces the cultural evolution of the infographic, examining its use in news—and resistance to its use—from eighteenth-century print culture to today's data journalism. He identifies six historical phases of infographics in popular culture: the proto-infographic, the classical, the improving, the commercial, the ideological, and the professional.Dick describes the emergence of infographic forms within a wider history of journalism, culture, and communications, focusing his analysis on the UK. He considers their use in the partisan British journalism of late eighteenth and early nineteenth-century print media; their later deployment as a vehicle for reform and improvement; their mass-market debut in the twentieth century as a means of explanation (and sometimes propaganda); and their use for both ideological and professional purposes in the post–World War II marketized newspaper culture. Finally, he proposes best practices for news infographics and defends infographics and data visualization against a range of criticism. Dick offers not only a history of how the public has experienced and understood the infographic, but also an account of what data visualization can tell us about the past.},

They are artistic works able to change their behavior in response to the behavior of the viewers, turning them into (more or less) active participants. This paper discusses an interactive installation the authors developed during the beginning of 2012 for the St. Elmo Castle in Naples, Italy. In this installation the audience determines the evolution of the life cycle of specific plants, in terms of an opening/closing process. The paper proposes some reflections on this case study, especially about the engagement dimension promoted by the work.},

  abstract = {Culture is a unique and fascinating aspect of the human species.  How did it emerge and how does it develop? Richard Dawkins has suggested that culture evolves and that memes are the cultural replicators, subject to variation and selection in the same way as genes function in the biological world. In this sense human culture is the product of a mindless evolutionary algorithm. Does this imply that we are mere meme machines and that the conscious self is an illusion? Kate Distin extends and strengthens Dawkins's theory and presents a fully developed and workable concept of cultural DNA. She argues that culture's development can be seen both as the result of memetic evolution and as the product of human creativity. Memetic evolution is therefore compatible with the view of humans as conscious and intelligent.},

However, developing successful machine learning applications requires a substantial amount of “black art” that is hard to find in textbooks.

Therefore, we propose a new framework that meets this need and facilitates the long-term aim of constructing a comprehensive taxonomy of generative art. Our framework is divided into four major components: a description of a work's entities; its processes and their environmental interactions; and the outcomes experienced by the work's audience. We describe a set of diverse generative artworks in terms of our framework, demonstrating how it can be applied in practice to compare and contrast them.},

Suggestions are made for applying these dimensions to multiple forms of computer-mediated communication. Future research should empirically test the existence and application of these dimensions.},

His work on the institutions of mental health and medicine, the history of systems of knowledge, literature and literary theory, criminality and the prison system, and sexuality, has had a profound and enduring impact across the humanities and social sciences. This introductory book, written for students, offers in-depth critical and contextual perspectives on all of Foucault's major published works. It provides ways in to understanding Foucault's key concepts of subjectivity, discourse, and power and explains the problems of translation encountered in reading Foucault in English. The book also explores the critical reception of Foucault's works and acquaints the reader with the afterlives of some of his theories, particularly his influence on feminist and queer studies. This book offers the ideal introduction to a famously complex, controversial and important thinker.},

The computers and smart phones that constantly flood us with images do more than simply convey information. They structure our relationship to information through graphical formats. Learning to interpret how visual forms not only present but produce knowledge, says Johanna Drucker, has become an essential contemporary skill.  Graphesis provides a descriptive critical language for the analysis of graphical knowledge. In an interdisciplinary study fusing digital humanities with media studies and graphic design history, Drucker outlines the principles by which visual formats organize meaningful content. Among the most significant of these formats is the graphical user interface (GUI)--the dominant feature of the screens of nearly all consumer electronic devices. Because so much of our personal and professional lives is mediated through visual interfaces, it is important to start thinking critically about how they shape knowledge, our behavior, and even our identity.  Information graphics bear tell-tale signs of the disciplines in which they originated: statistics, business, and the empirical sciences. Drucker makes the case for studying visuality from a humanistic perspective, exploring how graphic languages can serve fields where qualitative judgments take priority over quantitative statements of fact. Graphesis offers a new epistemology of the ways we process information, embracing the full potential of visual forms and formats of knowledge production.},

The first one—that of Jacques Rancière—stresses the idea of aesthetic autonomy as a result of a historical process that began with Kant’s Critique of Judgement, reaching its most developed form in contemporaneity, and the second model, represented here by Richard Shusterman (inspired by John Dewey pragmatist aesthetics), focuses on the deep roots that artistic phenomena have in society and culminates with his analysis of the hip hop culture. Taking into account as well their respectively fruitfulness as some of their limitations and inspired by Theodor Adorno, I propose the concept of “social-aesthetic construct”, which is meant to be a mediation between the aforementioned opposed models.},

  url = {http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/duchamp-female-fig-leaf-t07279/text-summary},
  abstract = {In the 1950s Duchamp created a series of four small-scale 'erotic objects': Not a Shoe (1950, Jedermann Collection), Female Fig Leaf (1961 bronze cast, Tate Gallery T07279), Dart Object (1962 bronze cast, Tate Gallery T07280), and Wedge of Chastity (1963 bronze and dental plastic edition, Tate Gallery T07281). Not a Shoe is thought to be an early version of the wedge section in Wedge of Chastity. After Duchamp's death, these pieces were found to be connected with Etant donnés, or Given, the piece on which Duchamp worked in secret between 1946 and 1966 and which is now installed at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Etant donnés can be seen as a three-dimensional realisation of the action alluded to in The Bride Stripped Bare by her Bachelors, Even (replica in Tate Gallery, \_c.htm"\&gt;T02011). Etant donnés consists of an elaborate erotic tableau of a female nude with legs spread, and is viewed through a peep-hole in a wooden door. Female Fig Leaf is thought to be based on a mould of the exposed parts of the female figure in Etant donnés. In 1950 Duchamp made two plaster moulds of Female Fig Leaf, one of which he gave to the artist Man Ray as a gift when the latter left New York for Paris. From this mould Man Ray supervised in 1951 the making of ten examples in painted plaster. The Tate's version is one of ten unnumbered examples produced in bronze in 1961 by the Galerie Rive Droite, Paris. The sculpture embodies several paradoxes: what might be a cast of female genitalia is a reverse imprint; and although an 'invasive' mould of the bride's sex, the piece is designated a 'fig leaf', a term conjuring associations of prudery and censorship. When the sculpture was reproduced on the cover of the first issue of Le Surréalisme, même in 1956, it was lit in such a way as to suggest a convex rather than a concave form.},

The axis of this dialogue is the difference between centre and periphery, their multiple dimensions and their place in a theory of world society that can account for the multiplicity and contingency of relations between centres and peripheries in contemporary modernity. Dependency theories usually vary in the way they observe or neglect the contingency of the economic and political dependency structures of the peripheral countries in relation to the central countries. In this sense, a comparison between the conceptions of André Gunder Frank and Enzo Faletto/Fernando Henrique Cardoso seems interesting. Through this comparison, it seems to us that the reference frameworks of Cardoso and Faletto's analysis remain current for interpreting the reconfigurations in the relations between centre and periphery, although it is necessary to broaden these frameworks, including both a greater differentiation in the degree of dependency and other spheres of social life, and emphasising the multidimensional and pluralised character of the relations between centre and periphery.},

The Orion team, led by the American bomb-designer Theodore B. Taylor, included the physicist Freeman Dyson, whose son George was five years old when the existence of the project was first announced. In Project Orion, George Dyson has synthesized hundreds of hours of interviews and thousands of pages of newly excavated documents, still only partially declassified, to piece together one of the most tantalizing "what if" stories of the twentieth century.},

The codes unleashed within this embryonic, 5-kilobyte universe—less memory than is allocated to displaying a single icon on a computer screen today—broke the distinction between numbers that mean things and numbers that do things, and our universe would never be the same. Turing’s Cathedral is the story of how the most constructive and most destructive of twentieth-century inventions—the digital computer and the hydrogen bomb—emerged at the same time.},

  abstract = {A central strategy in selling information technology has involved the appropriation of earlier historical notions of the ether: as an immersive environment, communicative medium and electronic presence. Just as telephony was connected to the ‘wireless ether’, virtual reality and cyberspace have been connected to the idea of a virtual, electronic sphere, represented as an informatic space, through which a mode of (digital) being is conducted. However, as this paper will argue, while the data trails generated through ‘dataveillance’ technologies, or the information collected by wearable computers, may indeed situate the individual within a digitally rendered ‘ether’, these technologies are based on the generation of knowledge more than the creation of a space, installing an epistemological, rather than an ontological framework for understanding telepresent agency. With reference to recent works by Canadian artist Catherine Richards, this paper will discuss both research into new ‘reality mining’ and ‘affective computing’ technologies and the discourse of posthumanism, as it elaborates the transformation from autonomous liberal subject to post-human hybrid currently underway, and the developing relationships between humans and embodied, emotionally intelligent machines.},

  abstract = {In this book Umberto Eco argues that translation is not about comparing two languages, but about the interpretation of a text in two different languages, thus involving a shift between cultures. An author whose works have appeared in many languages, Eco is also the translator of Gérard de Nerval's Sylvie and Raymond Queneau's Exercices de style from French into Italian. In Experiences in Translation he draws on his substantial practical experience to identify and discuss some central problems of translation. As he convincingly demonstrates, a translation can express an evident deep sense of a text even when violating both lexical and referential faithfulness. Depicting translation as a semiotic task, he uses a wide range of source materials as illustration: the translations of his own and other novels, translations of the dialogue of American films into Italian, and various versions of the Bible. In the second part of his study he deals with translation theories proposed by Jakobson, Steiner, Peirce, and others.Overall, Eco identifies the different types of interpretive acts that count as translation. An enticing new typology emerges, based on his insistence on a common-sense approach and the necessity of taking a critical stance.},

They not only have representational, expressive or illustrative functions, but also augment and create significant events. Beyond altering states of mind, they affect bodies and often life or death is at stake. Various forms of image operations are currently performed in the contexts of war, insurgency and activism. Photographs, videos, interactive simulations and other kinds of images steer drones to their targets, train soldiers, terrorise the public, celebrate protest icons, uncover injustices, or call for help. They are often parts of complex agential networks and move across different media and cultural environments. This book is a pioneering interdisciplinary study of the role and function of images in political life. Balancing theoretical reflections with in-depth case studies, it brings together renowned scholars and activists from different fields to offer a multifaceted critical perspective on a crucial aspect of contemporary visual culture.},

Issues relating to human–computer interaction (HCI) are as important to interactive art making as issues relating to the colours of paint are to painting. It is not that HCI and art necessarily share goals. It is just that much of the knowledge of HCI and its methods can contribute to interactive art making. This paper reviews recent work that looks at these issues in the art context. In interactive digital art, the artist is concerned with how the artwork behaves, how the audience interacts with it and, ultimately, in participant experience and their degree of engagement. The paper looks at these issues and brings together a collection of research results and art practice experiences that together help to illuminate this significant new and expanding area. In particular, it is suggested that this work points towards a much needed critical language that can be used to describe, compare and discuss interactive digital art.},

Besides that, to understand the meaning and impact of Social Media on elections, we show field results from the 2010 and 2011 elections in the Netherlands. There are several challenges when it comes to engaging people in party politics. The current findings in literature show us that previous efforts to shape public participation with prior Internet tools did not meet expectations. With Social Media this could change, because participation seems to be the key concept that explains the difference between ‘old’ web and ‘new’ Social Media. In the Netherlands, Social Media did not significantly influence voting behaviour during the local elections (2010/2011). But, during the national elections (2010), politicians with higher Social Media engagement got relatively more votes within most political parties. In conclusion, we propose a future research agenda to study how political parties could benefit from Social Media to reinvent and improve the way they work with their members and volunteers.},

  abstract = {The essays in this collection, which were written by European and North American specialists, position intermediality as a praxis of interpretative analysis in order to show how intermediality challenges our notion of art. The writers examine the various intermedial relations between the arts, which may take the form of reference to another form of art, a combination of two or more forms of art or a generic transformation from one form of art to another. In such cases, an intermedial approach helps us to grasp the changing relationship between the arts, which affects our reception of experience.Intermediality has profoundly changed our understanding of interdisciplinary relations, formerly examined in the field of interart studies. By introducing a medial aspect, intermediality has succeeded in making a “leap” from past practices of artistic interrelatedness to our contemporary medial age, in which literature along with other arts may be understood as a medium. This ambitious undertaking has contributed to the liberation of literature and other arts from an isolated position in the established scholarly landscape with its clear-cut borderlines between disciplines.The essays in this collection are a valuable contribution to this on-going discussion about the relationships between the arts. The variety of essays published in this collection makes it an excellent introduction to academics and university students in such disciplines as literature, music, theatre, art history and media studies. Due to its clarity – which does not sacrifice philosophical depth concerning the role of intermedial studies for several forms of art – this book will also be of interest to academics and students who are currently working at advanced level art schools.},

In fact, controlled darkness was essential to the rise of photography and cinema, science and spectacle, and a century of advanced art and film. Artificial Darkness is the first book to historicize and theorize this phenomenon and map its applications across a range of media and art forms. In exploring how artificial darkness shaped modern art, film, and media, Noam M. Elcott addresses seminal and obscure works alongside their sites of production—such as photography darkrooms, film studios, and laboratories—and their sites of reception, including theaters, cinemas, and exhibitions. He argues that artists, scientists, and entertainers like Étienne-Jules Marey, Richard Wagner, Georges Méliès, and Oskar Schlemmer revolutionized not only images but also everything surrounding them: the screen, the darkness, and the experience of bodies and space. At the heart of the book is “the black screen,” a technology of darkness that spawned today’s blue and green screens and has undergirded numerous advanced art and film practices to this day. Turning familiar art and film narratives on their heads, Artificial Darkness is a revolutionary treatment of an elusive, yet fundamental, aspect of art and media history.},

First, the ubiquitous intangibility of software simulation in everyday life is framed in terms of the Marxist concept of “realization” in circulation. Second, the “cloud’s” remote storage and processing of data is understood as a system of rents. These two processes reinforce the invisibility of the vast material resources consumed in order to perpetuate digital culture. After discussing the roots of this invisibility in enlightenment techno-science and its perpetuation through education, the essay argues that attempts to address social inequalities through cultural design should also engage with environmental issues.},

While other theories exist, such as how people unexpectedly encounter information, for example, they are typically related back to tasks, motivated by work or personal goals. This chapter, however, focuses on casual-leisure scenarios that are typically motivated by hedonistic needs rather than information needs, where people engage in searching behaviours for pleasure rather than to find information. This chapter describes two studies on (1) television information behaviour and (2) the casual information behaviours described by users of Twitter. The first study focuses on a specific casual-leisure domain that is familiar to many, while the second indicates that our findings generalise to many other casual-leisure scenarios. The results of these two studies are then used to define an initial model of casual-leisure information behaviour, which highlights the key differences between casual-leisure scenarios and typical information behaviour theory. The chapter concludes by discussing how this new model of casual-leisure information behaviour challenges the way we design information systems, measure their value and consequently evaluate their support for users.},

  abstract = {The twenty-first century has witnessed a pervasive militarization of aesthetics with Western military institutions co-opting the creative worldmaking of art and merging it with the destructive forces of warfare.     In Martial Aesthetics, Anders Engberg-Pedersen examines the origins of this unlikely merger, showing that today's creative warfare is merely the extension of a historical development that began long ago. Indeed, the emergence of martial aesthetics harkens back to a series of inventions, ideas, and debates in the eighteenth and early nineteenth century. Already then, military thinkers and inventors adopted ideas from the field of aesthetics about the nature, purpose, and force of art and retooled them into innovative military technologies and a new theory that conceptualized war not merely as a practical art, but as an aesthetic art form. This book shows how military discourses and early war media such as star charts, horoscopes, and the Prussian wargame were entangled with ideas of creativity, genius, and possible worlds in philosophy and aesthetic theory (by thinkers such as Leibniz, Baumgarten, Kant, and Schiller) in order to trace the emergence of martial aesthetics. Adopting an approach that is simultaneously historical and theoretical, Engberg-Pedersen presents a new frame for understanding war in the twenty-first century.},

By illustrating the intertwining of the technological developments in communication methods and its community-building effects, the different representations of society and their political implications are examined against the development of communication systems from the telegraph, to the telephone, to computer networks. It was the telegraph that made communication a continual process, thus freeing it from the rhythmical motion of the postal service and from physical transportation in general, and provided both a model and a mechanism of control. Using the theories of both Foucault and Heidegger to provide a lens for new investigation, the author studies not the meanings of communication and its logic as such but rather the conditions and structures that allow meanings and logic to be formulated in the first place.The book offers an original combination of historical analysis with an ontological discussion of the evolution of telecommunications in the U.S. as a phenomenon of modern social ordering.},

  abstract = {In the popular imagination, archives are remote, largely obsolete institutions: either antiquated, inevitably dusty libraries or sinister repositories of personal secrets maintained by police states. Yet the archive is now a ubiquitous feature of digital life. Rather than being deleted, e-mails and other computer files are archived. Media software and cloud storage allow for the instantaneous cataloging and preservation of data, from music, photographs, and videos to personal information gathered by social media sites.In this digital landscape, the archival-oriented media theories of Wolfgang Ernst are particularly relevant. Digital Memory and the Archive, the first English-language collection of the German media theorist’s work, brings together essays that present Ernst’s controversial materialist approach to media theory and history. His insights are central to the emerging field of media archaeology, which uncovers the role of specific technologies and mechanisms, rather than content, in shaping contemporary culture and society.Ernst’s interrelated ideas on the archive, machine time and microtemporality, and the new regimes of memory offer a new perspective on both current digital culture and the infrastructure of media historical knowledge. For Ernst, different forms of media systems—from library catalogs to sound recordings—have influenced the content and understanding of the archive and other institutions of memory. At the same time, digital archiving has become a contested site that is highly resistant to curation, thus complicating the creation and preservation of cultural memory and history.},

Rather than recuperate Burnham’s theory to deepen our understanding of post-formalist art of the 20th century, the author suggests applying the systems aesthetics approach to contemporary video game art. This proposal moves Burnham’s metaphorical analysis of software to a material application that can integrate video game artworks with other art traditions. The author argues that video game art is a cogent cultural context for understanding systems aesthetics in the 21st century and that taking up the systems aesthetics approach is critically important for applying arthistorical work to techno-political matters.},

Specifically, the author examines the emergence of “high definition television” (HDTV) as a new movement of experimentation and standardization in the 1970s and 1980s, spanning East and West in terms of sites, actors and issues. The paper offers a history of a particular Japanese experimental program and then discusses, in greater detail, a series of HDTV demonstrations carried out in the US in 1981 and how these (and a related demonstration in Europe 1982) were conceived and used at the time and later by parties involved in designing, operating, and controlling (HD)TV systems. Based upon this analysis, the paper concludes by showing that close empirical studies of demonstrations have much to tell us about the growth, (de)stabilization, and standardization of movements of innovation, including how their repertoire of founding stories, heroes, and standards expands and evolves.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

With the country in political crisis, the law made civil-service applicants the targets of domestic intelligence investigation by the Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz (Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution) and was the latest official move to counter fears inflamed by increasingly violent attacks by the guerrilla Red Army Faction.

With the advent of ubiquitous computing, the self becomes an object of technological application, increasingly defined by data received from tracking technologies. Subtly, these technologies encourage versions of ourselves that are easier to interpret computationally. Fedorova views these shifts in self-perception through the lens of contemporary media art practices, examining a range of artistic tactics that enable embodied and intimate experiences of machinic operations on our lives},

The digital sheds a new light on what is so fundamental for sustaining our human sense of the self, the psychological effects of the mechanisms of projection and recognition. Biofeedback, machine vision and remote sensing technologies enhance and augment our ability to understand and reflect on ourselves, but they also simulate our image and sense of ourselves and our relations with others and with the environment. While allowing deeper and more intimate connection to oneself, they also become means for manipulation and control - manipulation of our understanding and feeling of who we are. The author argues that digitally mediated versions of ourselves create feedback loops that place us in an intersubjective space, confusing the boundaries of the 'self', and therefore, challenging our capacity to feel human"--},

This approach fosters a variety of skills -- critical reading, analytical thinking, creative synthesis, and attention to detail -- that are important for everyone, not just future computer programmers.The book exposes readers to two fundamentally new ideas. First, it presents program design guidelines that show the reader how to analyze a problem statement; how to formulate concise goals; how to make up examples; how to develop an outline of the solution, based on the analysis; how to finish the program; and how to test. Each step produces a well-defined intermediate product. Second, the book comes with a novel programming environment, the first one explicitly designed for beginners. The environment grows with the readers as they master the material in the book until it supports a full-fledged language for the whole spectrum of programming tasks.All the book's support materials are available for free on the Web. The Web site includes the environment, teacher guides, exercises for all levels, solutions, and additional projects.},

Accordingly, in addition to professional skills, architectural designers must keep on learning the knowledge and methods of digital interactive design and develop the awareness of studying inhabitants' behaviors. Architectural design has become an integration process of massive information in a way that is different from traditional design ideas. Therefore, designers need to look for more appropriate building skin design methods in this new period of architectural design.},

They arise from our own acts and they are imposed on us. In this Very Short Introduction, Baruch Fischhoff and John Kadvany draw on both the sciences and humanities to illuminate both the similarities and differences of various kinds of risk. Using conceptual frameworks such as decision theory and behavioral decision research, they examine the science and practice of creating measures of risk and look at how scientists apply probability by combining historical records, scientific theories, and expert judgment. Perhaps more important, they show what science has learned about how people deal with risks, applying these lessons to diverse everyday examples, demonstrating how we can move from understanding a risk to making a choice to diminish risk in everyday life.},

  abstract = {There is no consensus yet on the definition of semantic information. This paper contributes to the current debate by criticising and revising the Standard Definition of semantic Information (SDI) as meaningful data, in favour of the Dretske-Grice approach: meaningful and well-formed data constitute semantic information only if they also qualify as contingently truthful. After a brief introduction, SDI is criticised for providing necessary but insufficient conditions for the definition of semantic information. SDI is incorrect because truth-values do not supervene on semantic information, and misinformation (that is, false semantic information) is not a type of semantic information, but pseudo-information, that is not semantic information at all. This is shown by arguing that none of the reasons for interpreting misinformation as a type of semantic information is convincing, whilst there are compelling reasons to treat it as pseudo-information. As a consequence, SDI is revised to include a necessary truth-condition. The last section summarises the main results of the paper and indicates some interesting areas of application of the revised definition.},

  abstract = {In 1939, a young Vilém Flusser faced the Nazi invasion of his hometown of Prague. He escaped with his wife to Brazil, taking with him only two books: a small Jewish prayer book and Goethe’s Faust. Twenty-six years later, in 1965, Flusser would publish The History of the Devil, and it is the essence of those two books that haunts his own. From that time his life as a philosopher was born. While Flusser would later garner attention in Europe and elsewhere as a thinker of media culture, The History of the Devil is considered by many to be his first significant work, containing nascent forms of the main themes that would come to preoccupy him over the following decades.In The History of the Devil, Flusser frames the human situation from a pseudo-religious point of view. The phenomenal world, or “reality” in a general sense, is identified as the “Devil,” and that which transcends phenomena, or the philosophers’ and theologians’ “reality,” is identified as “God.” Referencing Wittgenstein’s Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus in its structure, Flusser provocatively leads the reader through an existential exploration of nothingness as the bedrock of reality, where “phenomenon” and “transcendence,” “Devil” and “God” become fused and confused. So radically confused, in fact, that Flusser suggests we abandon the quotation marks from the terms “Devil” and “God.” At this moment of abysmal confusion, we must make the existential decisions that give direction to our lives.},

The Second Principle of Thermodynamics states that information contained within nature tends to be forgotten. Living organisms contradict that principle by preserving and transmitting genetic information. They constitute a memory in defiance of the entropy of nature. Mendel's biological law states that acquired information cannot be transmitted from organism to organism. Our species contradicts that law by having an elaborate cultural memory, progressively storing acquired information to which successive generations have access. This double negation of nature, although only temporary, constitutes the human condition. Human dignity, which distinguishes us from all other known beings, can be defined as the fact that we have both a genetic and a cultural memory, that we are 'historical beings'. Human dignity will acquire new meaning as electronic memories radically transform our cultural memory. This article considers some aspects of that transformation.},

  abstract = {Background Product design teams have been routinely conducting studies in design research since the late 1970s, when research became a more-accepted part of the design process. However, most of the research conducted falls into the category of what Richard Buchanan termed "clinical" research – focused on gathering information for a specific project being undertaken by a design team. This paper asserts that unless more encompassing forms of research are undertaken, the full potential of design to have a positive impact on our lives will not be realized. With a single goal of finalizing a project, designers typically forgo the collection and dissemination of knowledge that would advance the state of the design profession. The profession therefore tends to place its value on "what designers do" instead of "what designers know." Methods This paper references past articles on the topic of design research and knowledge, and combines their thoughts with observations by the author of common practices in the design profession. Results While this paper is not reporting on results of a specific study in design research, it strives to put the current state of design and research activities in perspective, with a call to leave design's past practices behind to expand and evolve our knowledge in design – by focusing on better understanding of people. It also suggests that the methods by which design teams are assembled, in an agency or corporate design department, can have limitations. An alternative model, being tested by some, calls for the formation of collectives of experts in design-related topics, putting together teams of the "most appropriate" people, not the "most available," as is often the situation in realworld practice. Conclusions The methods developed and touted by designers since the late 1970s, now commonplace, call for research activities to take place at the outset of a project to guide design efforts. Research conducted in the majority of projects is process-based, meant to reach a goal as opposed to add to a wider knowledge base. This paper makes the case however that in order to advance the profession, to further unleash the power of design, a change in mindset must be implemented. More value needs to be placed on knowledge in design.},

  abstract = {This essay argues for a materialist elaboration of the insight that historical time is nonidentical with itself. It sees in such time the seeds of utopian futurity that lie latent in the historical present yet are systematically foreclosed by it. The utopianism at issue involves a radical constriction of desire and a global redistribution of precarity, which together render the utopian imagination responsive to the finite character of the earth's resources. Certain works of contemporary literature are especially revelatory in this context. They invite us to live through the texture of their forms both the heterogeneity of historical time and the incipience of a transfigured future in which (to quote Anahid Nersessian) the world will be "lightened of the burden of furnishing abundance" because humans have become "agents of less catastrophic harm."}

With virtuoso showmanship, he weaves an intensely complex history of thought. He dips into literature, art, economics and even biology in The Order of Things, possibly one of the most significant, yet most overlooked, works of the twentieth century. Eclipsed by his later work on power and discourse, nonetheless it was The Order of Things that established Foucault's reputation as an intellectual giant. Pirouetting around the outer edge of language, Foucault unsettles the surface of literary writing. In describing the limitations of our usual taxonomies, he opens the door onto a whole new system of thought, one ripe with what he calls "exotic charm." Intellectual pyrotechnics from the master of critical thinking, this book is crucial reading for those who wish to gain insight into that odd beast called Postmodernism, and a must for any fan of Foucault.},

In "Society Must Be Defended," Foucault deals with the emergence in the early seventeenth century of a new understanding of war as the permanent basis of all institutions of power, a hidden presence within society that could be deciphered by an historical analysis. Tracing this development, Foucault outlines the genealogy of power and knowledge that had become his dominant concern.},

  abstract = {In post-millennial societies, creativity is heralded as crucial to individuals and societies, valuable for the economy, essential for leadership and vital for the future of work. In our unprecedented times, creativity is a necessary attribute that universities are embracing to ensure future-proof and employable graduates. However, there is a scant literature on how creativity is embraced in the assemblage of higher education. To ascertain if a common definition of creativity is used by higher education institutes, we conducted a systematic literature review that initially identified 2990 papers. Findings confirm that a definition of creativity in higher education does not exist nor is there a commonly cited definition, and several domains (e.g. social and cultural) influence the definition of creativity. Although creativity remains elusive, it is necessary for growth, survival and success. The potential dilemma of an agreed and shared definition of creativity applicable to the heterogeneous demands of higher education is presented},

  abstract = {Is there a cultural logic of what we have come to call the information age? Have the technologies and techniques centered on the computer provided not only tools but also the metaphors through which we now understand the social and economic formation of our world? In  Control, Seb Franklin addresses the conditions of knowledge that make the concept of the "information economy" possible while at the same time obscuring its deleterious effects on material social spaces. In so doing, Franklin traces three intertwined threads: the relationships among information, labor, and social management that emerged in the nineteenth century; the mid-twentieth-century diffusion of computational metaphors; and the appearance of informatic principles in certain contemporary socioeconomic and cultural practices.Drawing on critical theory, media theory, and the history of science, Franklin names  control as the episteme grounding late capitalism. Beyond any specific device or set of technically mediated practices, digitality functions within this episteme as the logical basis for reshaped concepts of labor, subjectivity, and collectivity, as well as for the intensification of older modes of exclusion and dispossession. In tracking the pervasiveness of this logical mode into the present, Franklin locates the cultural traces of control across a diverse body of objects and practices, from cybernetics to economic theory and management styles, and from concepts of language and subjectivity to literary texts, films, and video games.},

Philipp Frank, a distinguished physicist and philosopher in his own right, traces the history of science from Aristotle to Einstein to illustrate philosophy’s ongoing role in the scientific process.Suitable for undergraduate students and other readers, this volume explains modern technology’s role in the gradual erosion of the rapport between physical theories and philosophical systems, and offers suggestions for restoring the link between these related areas. Dr. Frank examines the ancient Greek concept of natural science to illustrate the development of modern science; then, using geometry as an example, he charts its progress from Euclidean principles through the interpretations of Descartes, Mill, Kant, and the rise of four-dimensional and non-Euclidean geometry. Additional topics include the laws of motion, before and after innovations of Galileo and Newton; perceptions of motion, light, and relativity through the ages; metaphysical interpretations of relativistic physics; the motion of atomic objects and the phenomena and formulations of atomic physics; and the principle of causality and the validation of theories.},

Drawing upon the intersecting matrices of digital literacy and media literacy, the volume provides a framework for developing critical digital literacies by exploring the necessary skills and competencies for engaging students as citizens of the digital world.},

Because the revealing of the sublime is deferred, Magritte’s perspective derives more from a modernist post-religious context that is neither dependent on a metaphysical absolute, nor a secular renunciation of the sacred. This article therefore challenges the view that Magritte’s surrealist art belongs either to an anti-sublime tradition, one that dismantles any illusory solace to transcendent qualities, or a postmodern ideology that posits a fundamental split between representation and reality.},

  publisher = {W.W. Norton},
  abstract = {It stands as a brilliant summary of the views on culture from a psychoanalytic perspective that he had been developing since the turn of the century. It is both witness and tribute to the late theory of mind—the so-called structural theory, with its stress on aggression, indeed the death drive, as the pitiless adversary of eros. Civilization and Its Discontents is one of the last of Freud's books, written in the decade before his death and first published in German in 1929. In it he states his views on the broad question of man's place in the world, a place Freud defines in terms of ceaseless conflict between the individual's quest for freedom and society's demand for conformity. Freud's theme is that what works for civilization doesn't necessarily work for man. Man, by nature aggressive and egotistical, seeks self-satisfaction. But culture inhibits his instinctual drives. The result is a pervasive and familiar guilt.Of the various English translations of Freud's major works to appear in his lifetime, only one was authorized by Freud himself: The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud under the general editorship of James Strachey. Freud approved the overall editorial plan, specific renderings of key words and phrases, and the addition of valuable notes, from bibliographical and explanatory. Many of the translations were done by Strachey himself; the rest were prepared under his supervision. The result was to place the Standard Edition in a position of unquestioned supremacy over all other existing versions.},

  abstract = {Much acclaimed and highly controversial, Michael Fried's art criticism defines the contours of late modernism in the visual arts. This volume contains twenty-seven pieces, including the influential introduction to the catalog for Three American Painters, the text of his book Morris Louis, and the renowned "Art and Objecthood." Originally published between 1962 and 1977, they continue to generate debate today. These are uncompromising, exciting, and impassioned writings, aware of their transformative power during a time of intense controversy about the nature of modernism and the aims and essence of advanced painting and sculpture. Ranging from brief reviews to extended essays, and including major critiques of Jackson Pollock, Morris Louis, Kenneth Noland, Jules Olitski, Frank Stella, and Anthony Caro, these writings establish a set of basic terms for understanding key issues in high modernism: the viability of Clement Greenberg’s account of the infralogic of modernism, the status of figuration after Pollock, the centrality of the problem of shape, the nature of pictorial and sculptural abstraction, and the relationship between work and beholder. In a number of essays Fried contrasts the modernist enterprise with minimalist or literalist art, and, taking a position that remains provocative to this day, he argues that minimalism is essentially a genre of theater, hence artistically self-defeating.For this volume Fried has also provided an extensive introductory essay in which he discusses how he became an art critic, clarifies his intentions in his art criticism, and draws crucial distinctions between his art criticism and the art history he went on to write. The result is a book that is simply indispensable for anyone concerned with modernist painting and sculpture and the task of art criticism in our time.},

We consider art not as static, but as dynamic and complex, it permanently changes, interpretations of artworks permanently (re-)emerge, new artworks emerge, etc. In the first section we will discuss different conceptual approaches of art theory. In section 2 we introduce a dynamic concept of art that is based on processes of cognition (2.1.), communication (2.2.), and co-operation (2.3). In section 3 we discuss the historical development of art as a dynamic process, in section 4 we take a look the idea of the autonomy of art in society and the relationship of art and society, in section 5 we outline the role of art in capitalism and communism. Methodologically we advance from the abstract to the concrete, we first discuss what the essence of art is on a more abstract level, then we outline informational aspects of cognition, communication, and co-operation of the artistic production process. The analysis of the dynamic evolution of art and of the autonomy of art introduces an already more concrete level of analysis where the role of art in society is discussed. Finally we discuss the role of art in the societal formation that we live in - capitalism - and possible future developments of art in society. Hence we reach a concrete level of analyis that describes the present and points towards the future.},

  abstract = {This review explores the present fashion for aesthetics in contemporary sociology. It evaluates the claims that society is undergoing a deep-seated process of aestheticization, and that sociology is experiencing an aestheticization of its epistemological concerns. The aestheticization literature is divided as follows: (1) the re-reading of classical sociological theory through the aesthetic dimension of modernity; (2) the claim that postmodern society involves an `aestheticization of everyday life'; and (3) those sociological theories which stress that contemporary society is more and more like a work of art in its form. The argument is made that the discovery of aesthetics as a way of problematizing sociological reasoning is to some extent rediscovery, returning to various Kantian precepts: the disinterestedness characteristic of aesthetic experiences; the antinomy between the individual and the social aspects of taste; and the work of art as an organism predicated on an inner teleology.},

Critiquing existing genealogies that understand computer generated images as the outgrowth of prior visual media forms, the author suggests that graphics offer us a uniquely computational image form, one concerned less with realism and mimesis than with delimiting the world through the black boxing of vision. Focusing on one of the most significant challenges to the field of computer graphics research from 1963–1979 – what is known as the ‘hidden-line’ or ‘hidden-surface’ problem – the article argues that the material logic of the digital image is not one of inscription but restriction, a making absent.},

And how is the electrical storm of neurons under our skull connected with our consciousness? Is the self only our brain’s user interface, a kind of stage on which a show is performed that we cannot freely direct? In this book, philosopher Markus Gabriel challenges an increasing trend in the sciences towards neurocentrism, a notion which rests on the assumption that the self is identical to the brain. Gabriel raises serious doubts as to whether we can know ourselves in this way. In a sharp critique of this approach, he presents a new defense of the free will and provides a timely introduction to philosophical thought about the self – all with verve, humor, and surprising insights.Gabriel criticizes the scientific image of the world and takes us on an eclectic journey of self-reflection by way of such concepts as self, consciousness, and freedom, with the aid of Kant, Schopenhauer, and Nagel but also Dr. Who, The Walking Dead, and Fargo.},

  abstract = {Where do we come from? Are we merely a cluster of elementary particles in a gigantic world receptacle? And what does it all mean? In this highly original new book, the philosopher Markus Gabriel challenges our notion of what exists and what it means to exist. He questions the idea that there is a world that encompasses everything like a container life, the universe, and everything else. This all-inclusive being does not exist and cannot exist. For the world itself is not found in the world. And even when we think about the world, the world about which we think is obviously not identical with the world in which we think. For, as we are thinking about the world, this is only a very small event in the world. Besides this, there are still innumerable other objects and events: rain showers, toothaches and the World Cup. Drawing on the recent history of philosophy, Gabriel asserts that the world cannot exist at all, because it is not found in the world. Yet with the exception of the world, everything else exists; even unicorns on the far side of the moon wearing police uniforms. Revelling in witty thought experiments, word play, and the courage of provocation, Markus Gabriel demonstrates the necessity of a questioning mind and the role that humour can play in coming to terms with the abyss of human existence.},

  abstract = {In the avant-garde production of images and texts, one finds a set of aesthetic and cultural practices heavily invested in the metaphorical system of the machine. Yet there is little in Dada machine art to recall the mechanistic worldview of earlier writers and thinkers---the deterministic order of the Cartesian body, for example, or the materialist hypothesis of La Mettrie. Instead, one finds various attempts to introduce breaks or ruptures into the deterministic order of the machine. It is not the description of the world as mechanism, but a production of imaginary worlds driven by the force of the virtual and revolving around a singularity (an element of chance or "straying cause") that always exceeds the structural relations put forward by mechanical laws. One finds this particularly in the early "proto-Dada" works of Marcel Duchamp and Francis Picabia, but also in those of Jean Crotti and the Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven, as well as several others who took part in an intercontinental movement during the period 1912-1922 known as New York Dada. Linking this movement to the writers and texts that inspired it (Raymond Roussel, Jean-Pierre Brisset and Alfred Jarry, but also Nietzsche and Freud), I consider how machines provide a working model for a new theory of production, as well as a "demiurgic" shift in human thought and agency at the level of representation. With references to the works of Gilles Deleuze and FÃ©lix Guattari (in particular, their concepts of deterritorialization, multiplicity, and singularities-events), and also to Walter Benjamin's conception of the aura, I explore the consequences of this shift. The new subjectivity, I conclude, is characterized by hybridity, delirium, automatism, and a troubling ambiguity between the self and its technological other.},

There is a fundamental philosophical split between the modern culture of science and the postmodern culture of the humanities. This cultural estrangement is, among other things, the underlying cause for the lack of acceptance of art-science and technology-based art in the mainstream art world. However, in the last two decades the study of complexity has introduced a revolution across the sciences. It is suggested here that complexity thinking can be extended to usher in a revolution in the humanities as well. The apparently irreconcilable world views of modernism and postmodernism can be subsumed and unified by a new synthesis called complexism. And artists working on the complexity frontier can serve a key role in helping to bring this about.},

  abstract = {XEPA anticipates a future where machines form their own societies. Going beyond mere generative art, machines will exhibit artistic creativity with the addition of artistic judgment via computational aesthetic evaluation. In such a future our notions of aesthetics will undergo a radical translation. The XEPA intelligent sculptures create animated light and sound sequences. Each sculpture “watches” the others and modifies its own aesthetic behavior to create a collaborative, improvisational performance. No coordination information or commands are used. Each XEPA independently evaluates the aesthetics of the other sculptures, infers a theme or mood being attempted, and then modifies its own aesthetics to better reinforce that theme. Each performance is unique and widely varied. XEPA is an ever-evolving artwork, intended as a platform for ongoing experiments in computational aesthetic evaluation.},

  abstract = {This volume combines social scientific methods with qualitative analysis to produce an interpretation of modern art. The art of the twentieth century broke completely with earlier artistic traditions. A basic change in the market for advanced art produced a heightened demand for innovation, and young conceptual innovators -- from Picasso and Duchamp to Rauschenberg and Warhol to Cindy Sherman and Damien Hirst -- responded not only by creating dozens of new forms of art, but also by behaving in ways that would have been incomprehensible to their predecessors. The author concludes that contemporary art is the logical result of conceptual innovators operating in a competitive market that has consistently rewarded radical and conspicuous innovation.},

  year = 2013,

  publisher = {University of Chicago Press},
  abstract = {Always connect—that is the imperative of today’s media. But what about those moments when media cease to function properly, when messages go beyond the sender and receiver to become excluded from the world of communication itself—those messages that state: “There will be no more messages”? In this book, Alexander R. Galloway, Eugene Thacker, and McKenzie Wark turn our usual understanding of media and mediation on its head by arguing that these moments reveal the ways the impossibility of communication is integral to communication itself—instances they call excommunication. ~ In three linked essays, Excommunication~pursues this elusive topic by looking at mediation in the face of banishment, exclusion, and heresy, and by contemplating the possibilities of communication with the great beyond. First, Galloway proposes an original theory of mediation based on classical literature and philosophy, using Hermes, Iris, and the Furies to map out three of the most prevalent modes of mediation today—mediation as exchange, as illumination, and as network. Then, Thacker goes boldly beyond Galloway’s classification scheme by examining the concept of excommunication through the secret link between the modern horror genre and medieval mysticism. Charting a trajectory of examples from H. P. Lovecraft to Meister Eckhart, Thacker explores those instances when one communicates or connects with the inaccessible, dubbing such modes of mediation “haunted” or “weird” to underscore their inaccessibility. Finally, Wark evokes the poetics of the infuriated swarm as a queer politics of heresy that deviates from both media theory and the traditional left. He posits a critical theory that celebrates heresy and that is distinct from those that now venerate Saint Paul. ~ Reexamining commonplace definitions of media, mediation, and communication, Excommunication~offers a glimpse into the realm of the nonhuman to find a theory of mediation adequate to our present condition.},

Unlike numerous online-print-books, Designershock take the experimental challenge of creating an interactive print medium, i.e. the book bestly "functions" in combination with the internet. The interactive user manual Designer Shock Operating System 1 (DSOS1) includes instructions and the accompanying System CD leads the (registered) user to exclusive links and stations that enable the downloading of special fonts and other tools.For example, the reader and user reaches the exclusive DSFonts on the website which are presented in the book. By playing the respective games (DSEPM-"Electronic-PlayMates"), he or she can win and download them. The book-site-system is rounded off by two further sections: DSTLS (Designer Shock Tools) and DSDT (Designer Shock Desk Top). In the Tools section, one discovers the DS M.E.E.E.K. (ModulatedEsotericE-TypeKreator). DS M.E.E.E.K. is an exciting, interactive tool for synthesizing and modulating pixel font layouts. Desk Top offers desktop decoration, including DS Screensavers, DS-Wallpapers and DS Icons. This absolutely innovative connection between print and web creates an optimal environment for presenting the newest Designershock works. It also provides the "user" with access to future exclusive software updates by Designershock.The e-zine www.designershock.com presents uncommon information about outstanding designers as well as Designershock's own theme-orientated graphics.},

  abstract = {이 논문은 디자인과 같은 실천영역의 문화적 이해를 위해서는 엄격한 개념적 설명에 기초한 사회, 문화이론의 도입이 필요하다는 문제의식에서 출발하여, 구조기능주의자이면서 체계이론가인 탈코트 파슨스를 문화이론적 관점에서 재구성 함으로써 디자인과 문화, 그리고 기능의 문제에 접근하는 문화 연구의 경로와 개념적 지도의 한 예를 제시한다. 디자인의 문화적 이해를 위한 사회이론적 탐구의 대상으로 파슨스를 선택한 이유 - 따라서 이 논문이 성취할 수 있는 잠재적인 이론적 성과 - 는 다음과 같다. 첫째, ``기능주의``를 통해 디자인이론과 사회이론을 연결함으로써 디자인의 실제적(경제적, 기술적) 기능뿐 아니라 미적 기능과 상징적 기능을 설명함과 동시에 디자인의 문화적 해석의 중요성을 제기하기 위해서이다. 사실상 기능에 대한 담론은 디자인사의 중심을 차지하여 왔으며, 이러한 담론의 배후에는 디자인의 실제적(경제적, 기술적) 기능과 미적 기능, 그리고 상징적기능 사이의 긴장이 존재한다. 둘째, 인간은 합리적이라는 전제에서 출발하여 경제적 차원의 설명만을 제공하는 디자인의 기능주의의 한계를 극복하는 데 있어서 기능적 사회이론의 도입이 지닌 유용성이다. 사회이론의 기능주의는 체계이론과 밀접하게 결합됨으로써 경제, 정치, 사회 체계와의 관련 속에서 문화체계를 규명할 뿐 아니라, ``경제적 인간`` 모델을 비판하고 인간 행위의 규범적 차원을 강조함으로써 문화이론적 함의를 풍부하게 내포한다. 셋째, 한국의 디자인학계, 특히 이들의 문화에 대한 이론적 고찰에서 빈번이 인용되는 트롬페나스(Trompenaars, 1994)나 호프스테드(Hofstede, 2010)의 문화변수 모델들의 원형은 파슨스가 그의 ``유형변수`` 모델을 통하여 이미 제시한 것이다. 그럼에도 불구하고 디자인의 문화연구는 기능적인 변수들의 유형화와 계량화에 집중함으로써 유형변수들을 활용하여 사회변동과 사회변동에서의 문화의 역할을 조명하려는 파슨스의 의도를 왜곡하여 적용한다. 이상의 이론적 공헌을 겨냥하면서, 나는 디자인의 기능주의, 인본주의를 지향하는 조형이론인 ``확장된 기능주의(extended functionalism)``, 그리고 파슨스로 대표되는 기능적 사회이론의 역사적 배경에 대한 설명으로부터 시작할 것이다. 그리고 나서 파슨스의 이론을 문화적 관점에서 재구성하여 분석할 것이다. 마지막으로 디자인의 문화적 이해에 대해 파슨스의 문화이론이 지니는 함의를 진단하면서 논문을 마무리할 것이다.},

  abstract = {Much as art history is in the process of being transformed by new information communication technologies, often in ways that are either disavowed or resisted, art practice is also being changed by those same technologies. One of the most obvious symptoms of this change is the increasing numbers of artists working in universities, and having their work facilitated and supported by the funding and infrastructural resources that such institutions offer. This new paradigm of art as research is likely to have a profound effect on how we understand the role of the artist and of art practice in society.   In this unique book, artists, art historians, art theorists and curators of new media reflect on the idea of art as research and how it has changed practice.  Intrinsic to the volume is an investigation of the advances in creative practice made possible via artists engaging directly with technology or via collaborative partnerships between practitioners and technological experts, ranging through a broad spectrum of advanced methods from robotics through rapid prototyping to the biological sciences.},

The analysis considers three sites of conceptual dislocations that have shaped the development and legacy of media research often associated with theorist Friedrich Kittler: first, the displacement of 1980s and 1990s Kittlerian media theory towards a more praxeological style of analysis in the early 2000s; second, the philological background that allowed the antiquated German appellation for agricultural engineering, Kulturtechniken, to migrate into media and cultural studies; and third, the role of these conceptual dislocations in enriching media-genealogical inquiries into topics such as life, biopolitics, and practice.},

This episode and several others in the epic anticipate stories in the Bible and in Homer, to the great interest of biblical and classical scholars. Told with intense feeling and imagination, this masterful tale of love and friendship, duty and death, is more than an object of scholarly concern; it is a vital rendering of universal themes that resonate across the ages and is considered the world's first truly great work of literature.},

Thequestion of the definition of morality is the question of identifyingthe target of moral theorizing. Identifying this targetenables us to see different moral theories as attempting to capturethe very same thing. And it enables psychologists, anthropologists,evolutionary biologists, and other more empirically-oriented theoriststo design their experiments or formulate their hypotheses withoutprejudicing matters too much in terms of the specific content a code,judgment, or norm must have in order to count as distinctivelymoral.},

  abstract = {From its beginnings in the 1920s until its demise in the 1980s, Bell Labs-officially, the research and development wing of AT\&T-was the biggest, and arguably the best, laboratory for new ideas in the world. From the transistor to the laser, from digital communications to cellular telephony, it's hard to find an aspect of modern life that hasn't been touched by Bell Labs.  In The Idea Factory, Jon Gertner traces the origins of some of the twentieth century's most important inventions and delivers a riveting and heretofore untold chapter of American history. At its heart this is a story about the life and work of a small group of brilliant and eccentric men-Mervin Kelly, Bill Shockley, Claude Shannon, John Pierce, and Bill Baker-who spent their careers at Bell Labs.  Today, when the drive to invent has become a mantra, Bell Labs offers us a way to enrich our understanding of the challenges and solutions to technological innovation. Here, after all, was where the foundational ideas on the management of innovation were born.},

Which is Their Saemaeul Movement written by Dr Young-Mi Kim.{$<$}BR{$>$} She carried out a rural Maeul[community] study through field work and oral history methodology that few historians have used recently. When she investigated several rural villages and some farmers in Icheon-si Gyeonggi-do, She found out that it was not the Saemaeul Movement that made the ‘new villages’, to say, Saemaeul. On the contrary, she concluded that those pre-existing new villages(Saemaeul) led to the Saemaeul Movement. In other words, the movement of self-help had already been started by indigenous leaders and farmers to modernize their own villages and build prosperous rural societies, especially since the Korean War, before Park's administration started on Saemaeul Movement in 1970s. Park's administration and supporters argued it was a successful movement, but it was a failure, in that the rural societies of Korea was being gradually weakened to a total collapse due to the manufacturing industry oriented policies in the process of industrialization.{$<$}BR{$>$} This paper examined the fruit of her long study, issues, and problems.

  publisher = {Cheongeurusoop},
  abstract = {아파트 살 돈으로 노후주택 사서 건축하는 법! 이제 [월급쟁이 건축주 되기 프로젝트]를 시작해 보자! “나는 1년 지나고 돈이 좀 더 모이면 해야지.” “나중에.... 지금은 아니야. 좀 더 여윳돈이 필요해.” 아직도 이런 말들로 당신의 삶을 합리화하고 있다면 이제는 그만 알에서 깨어날 시간이다. 당신의 한계는 여기까지라고 한정짓는 알에서 깨어나야 한다. 이제 선택의 순간이다. 당신이 건축주가 되어 월급쟁이 직장인의 굴레에서 벗어날 순간 말이다. 물론 월급쟁이 직장인들이 땅을 사고 건물을 짓기까지는 쉽지 않은 상황들의 연속이다. 어떤 땅을 사고, 자금은 어떻게 조달하며, 실제 건축하는 과정에서 수많은 예기치 못한 변수들이 발생할 것이다. 하지만 머뭇거리고 있기에는 지금의 현실이 만만치 않다. 이제는 ‘건축’이라는 부동산 투자의 새로운 패러다임을 받아들여 좀 더 자유로운 삶에 다가서야 한다. 이 책은 건축주가 되기 위한 준비작업에서부터 토지분석, 매입, 설계, 시공, 분양, 임대, 수지분석까지 건축에 필요한 모든 사항들을 정리해 놓았다. Part 1에서는 ‘건축주가 되어 두 번째 인생을 사는 사람들’을 소개하고 있다. 노후주택을 매입하거나 점포겸용주택을 분양받아 건축을 시작한 사람들, 공동투자를 통해 건축에 빠진 사람들, P2P 대출을 활용해 적은 금액으로 상가주택을 건축한 사람들의 이야기이다. Part 2 ‘오늘부터 당신은 예비 건축주’에서는 건축의 기본적인 과정에 대한 설명과 부동산 투자의 새로운 패러다임인 건축을 통해 2배의 수익을 올릴 수 있는 방법을 소개하고 있다. Part 3은 ‘건축주 되기 프로젝트’의 첫 번째 관문인 ‘토지 매입’에 대해 설명하고 있다. 어떤 토지를 구입해야 하는지, 왜 노후주택은 나대지로 봐야 하는지, 왜 썩은 주택이 황금알을 낳는 땅인지 등을 설명하고, 공간을 최대로 활용하는 방법과 노른자위 땅을 만드는 방법 등을 소개한다. Part 4 ‘실전 건축’에서는 설계사무소의 선정부터, 설계에 따른 공간의 비밀, 공사 공정에 따른 체크포인트와 부실공사를 막는 노하우를 설명한다. 또 계약이행증권을 통해 안전한 공사를 할 수 있는 방법을 소개한다. Part 5에서는 ‘P2P 금융을 활용한 자금 조달’에 대해 설명한다. 요즘 대세가 되고 있는 부동산 크라우드펀딩인 P2P 금융에 대해 자세히 설명하며, 왜 건축주들이 P2P 금융을 이용해야 하는지, 그들과 어떻게 윈윈해야 하는지를 설명한다. Part 6 ‘돈 되는 건축전략’에서는 건축의 재무제표라고 할 수 있는 ‘수지분석표’ 작성법부터 건축주를 위한 절세전략, 분양과 임대 중 어느 것이 유리한지, 1인가구의 증가에 따른 임대시장의 활용법 등을 설명한다. 우리에게 행복한 인생과 윤택한 삶은 권리이자 의무이다. 그런 권리와 의무는 누가 대신 찾아주는 것이 아니다. 바로 우리가 지금 당장 찾아 나서야 한다. ‘월급쟁이 건축주 되기 프로젝트’를 함께 해보자!},

  abstract = {In the World Wide Web environment, the information behavior model functions as a theoretical basis for constructing the information behavior tools. The traditional information behavior model is deduced from the generalization of the user behavior. However, this method has not enough strength to expose the essential cause which lies deeply inside the ordinary information behavior. To address this problem, it is necessary to redefine the meaning of information in the WWW environment. And through the result of this redefinition, it is possible to figure out the abstract model which can be regarded as the fundamental cause of information behavior. The information as an object of the information behavior is the set of the patterned signals. This proposition is discovered concurrently in cybernetics and information theory. Also, the WWW environment is consist of the documents and the linkages, in other words, of the simplified structure of the nodes and the edges. This structure has many similarities with the human linguistic behavior. Through these basses, it is assertible that the information behavior in the WWW environment is the structuring  documents, the set of pasteurized signals, in linguistic method. In the information behavior model of which the theoretical basis is derived from the Saussurian structural linguistics, the sets of documents are structured in the principle of syntagm and paradigm. The linguistic information behavior model grounded on the conceptualized characteristic of the information and the rule for the structuring the information behavior. Thus, the linguistic information behavior model can provide the fundamental methodology for the user interface architecture and the information retrieval system.},

As a real-time visualization tool, Transmission creates alternate representations of neural activity through sound and vision, investigating the effect of interaction on human consciousness. As a sonification project, it creates an immersive experience for two users: a soundscape created by the human mind and the influence of kinetic interaction. An electroencephalographic (EEG) headset interprets a user’s neural activity. An Open Sound Control (OSC) script then translates this data into a real-time particle stream and sound environment at one end. A second user in a remote location modifies this stream in real time through body movement. Together they become a telematic musical interface-communicating through visual and sonic representation of their interactions.},

  abstract = {In Always Already New, Lisa Gitelman explores the newness of new media while she asks what it means to do media history. Using the examples of early recorded sound and digital networks, Gitelman challenges readers to think about the ways that media work as the simultaneous subjects and instruments of historical inquiry. Presenting original case studies of Edison's first phonographs and the Pentagon's first distributed digital network, the ARPANET, Gitelman points suggestively toward similarities that underlie the cultural definition of records (phonographic and not) at the end of the nineteenth century and the definition of documents (digital and not) at the end of the twentieth. As a result, Always Already New speaks to present concerns about the humanities as much as to the emergent field of new media studies. Records and documents are kernels of humanistic thought, after all--part of and party to the cultural impulse to preserve and interpret. Gitelman's argument suggests inventive contexts for "humanities computing" while also offering a new perspective on such traditional humanities disciplines as literary history.Making extensive use of archival sources, Gitelman describes the ways in which recorded sound and digitally networked text each emerged as local anomalies that were yet deeply embedded within the reigning logic of public life and public memory. In the end Gitelman turns to the World Wide Web and asks how the history of the Web is already being told, how the Web might also resist history, and how using the Web might be producing the conditions of its own historicity.},

Whether examining late nineteenth century commercial, or "job" printing, or the Xerox machine and the role of reproduction in our understanding of the document, Gitelman reveals a keen eye for vernacular uses of technology. She tells nuanced, anecdote-filled stories of the waning of old technologies and the emergence of new. Along the way, she discusses documentary matters such as the relation between twentieth-century technological innovation and the management of paper, and the interdependence of computer programming and documentation. Paper Knowledge is destined to set a new agenda for media studies.},

  abstract = {This is a richly imaginative study of machines for writing and reading at the end of the nineteenth century in America. Its aim is to explore writing and reading as culturally contingent experiences, and at the same time to broaden our view of the relationship between technology and textuality.At the book’s heart is the proposition that technologies of inscription are materialized theories of language. Whether they failed (like Thomas Edison’s “electric pen”) or succeeded (like typewriters), inscriptive technologies of the late nineteenth century were local, often competitive embodiments of the way people experienced writing and reading. Such a perspective cuts through the determinism of recent accounts while arguing for an interdisciplinary method for considering texts and textual production.Starting with the cacophonous promotion of shorthand alphabets in postbellum America, the author investigates the assumptions—social, psychic, semiotic—that lie behind varying inscriptive practices. The “grooves” in the book’s title are the delicate lines recorded and played by phonographs, and readers will find in these pages a surprising and complex genealogy of the phonograph, along with new readings of the history of the typewriter and of the earliest silent films. Modern categories of authorship, representation, and readerly consumption emerge here amid the un- or sub-literary interests of patent attorneys, would-be inventors, and record producers. Modern subjectivities emerge both in ongoing social constructions of literacy and in the unruly and seemingly unrelated practices of American spiritualism, “Coon” songs, and Rube Goldberg-type romanticism.Just as digital networks and hypertext have today made us more aware of printed books as knowledge structures, the development and dissemination of the phonograph and typewriter coincided with a transformed awareness of oral and inscribed communication. It was an awareness at once influential in the development of consumer culture, literary and artistic experiences of modernity, and the disciplinary definition of the “human” sciences, such as linguistics, anthropology, and psychology. Recorded sound, typescripts, silent films, and other inscriptive media are memory devices, and in today’s terms the author offers a critical theory of ROM and RAM for the century before computers.},

  abstract = {The analytic philosophers writing here engage with the cluster of philosophical questions raised by conceptual art. They address four broad questions: What kind of art is conceptual art? What follows from the fact that conceptual art does not aim to have aesthetic value? What knowledge or understanding can we gain from conceptual art? How ought we to appreciate conceptual art? Conceptual art, broadly understood by the contributors as beginning with Marcel Duchamp's ready-mades and as continuing beyond the 1970s to include some of today's contemporary art, is grounded in the notion that the artist's 'idea' is central to art, and, contrary to tradition, that the material work is by no means essential to the art as such. To use the words of the conceptual artist Sol LeWitt, 'In conceptual art the idea of the concept is the most important aspect of the work . . . and the execution is a perfunctory affair'. Given this so-called 'dematerialization' of the art object, the emphasis on cognitive value, and the frequent appeal to philosophy by many conceptual artists, there are many questions that are raised by conceptual art that should be of interest to analytic philosophers. Why, then, has so little work been done in this area? This volume is most probably the first collection of papers by analytic philosophers tackling these concerns head-on.},

  abstract = {Advocates of computers make sweeping claims for their inherently transformative power: new and different from previous technologies, they are sure to resolve many of our existing social problems, and perhaps even to cause a positive political revolution. In The Cultural Logic of Computation, David Golumbia, who worked as a software designer for more than ten years, confronts this orthodoxy, arguing instead that computers are cultural “all the way down”―that there is no part of the apparent technological transformation that is not shaped by historical and cultural processes, or that escapes existing cultural politics. From the perspective of transnational corporations and governments, computers benefit existing power much more fully than they provide means to distribute or contest it. Despite this, our thinking about computers has developed into a nearly invisible ideology Golumbia dubs “computationalism”―an ideology that informs our thinking not just about computers, but about economic and social trends as sweeping as globalization. Driven by a programmer’s knowledge of computers as well as by a deep engagement with contemporary literary and cultural studies and poststructuralist theory, The Cultural Logic of Computation provides a needed corrective to the uncritical enthusiasm for computers common today in many parts of our culture.},

The work in the volume has a common aim in being sensitive to the thoughts of contextual nuances that disappear from large-scale quantitative modelling or explanations based on abstract, general, universal laws of human behavior. It shows that 'context matters' in a great many ways: philosophical context matters; psychological context matters; cultural and historical contexts matter; place, population, and technology all matter. By showcasing scholars who specialize in the analysis of all these contexts side-by-side, The Oxford Handbook of Contextual Political Analysis shows how political scientists can take those crucial contextual factors systematically into account.},

  abstract = {The aim of this book is to explain, carefully but not technically, the differences between advanced, research-level mathematics, and the sort of mathematics we learn at school. The most fundamental differences are philosophical, and readers of this book will emerge with a clearer understanding of paradoxical-sounding concepts such as infinity, curved space, and imaginary numbers. The first few chapters are about general aspects of mathematical thought. These are followed by discussions of more specific topics, and the book closes with a chapter answering common sociological questions about the mathematical community (such as "Is it true that mathematicians burn out at the age of 25?") It is the ideal introduction for anyone who wishes to deepen their understanding of mathematics.About the Series: Combining authority with wit, accessibility, and style, Very Short Introductions offer an introduction to some of life's most interesting topics. Written by experts for the newcomer, they demonstrate the finest contemporary thinking about the central problems and issues in hundreds of key topics, from philosophy to Freud, quantum theory to Islam.},

  abstract = {Friedrich Kittler's media history is rarely employed by humanities scholars, who are often alienated by his disregard for literary content or humanistic concerns. This article makes the case for engaging with Kittler's theories as a natural extension of the materialist turn common to a number of humanities disciplines. Here, I assemble a 'toolkit' from Kittler's ideas of recursion and transposition, and the study of cultural techniques that has flowed from his works, in order to propose a new way to conceive of ekphrasis and approach ekphrastic verse. I -position ekphrasis as an informative example of recursion in action. I compare Kittler's media history—and the insights yielded by the tools it offers us—to some of the most influential studies of ekphrasis and ekphrases, showing how a Kittlerian approach can shine a new light on the genre. I also offer a short illustrative example of applying these tools to ekphrastic work by analyzing Dante Gabriel Rossetti's 'A Sea Spell', by which I also hope to demonstrate how Kittler's ideas can assist twenty-first-century scholars in bridging the gap between our own medial situation and those in which our objects of study were produced.}

Retrieving relevant information from this kind of data is getting more and more difficult, not only for their volume, but also for the different nature and formats of their contents. In this work, we introduce Sentic Web, a new paradigm for the management of social media affective information, which exploits AI and Semantic Web techniques to extract, encode, and represent opinions and sentiments over the Web. In particular, the computational layer consists in an intelligent engine for the inference of emotions from text, the representation layer is developed on the base of specific domain ontologies, and the application layer is based on the faceted browsing paradigm to make contents available as an interconnected knowledge base.},

  abstract = {When the Internet emerged as a mass global communication network in the mid-1990s, artists immediately recognized the exciting possibilities for creative innovation that came with it. After a century of unprecedented artistic experimentation, individuals and groups were quick to use the new technologies to question and radically redefine the conventions of art, and to tackle some of the most pressing social, political, and ethical issues of the day. Covering email art, Web sites, artist-designed software, and projects that blur the boundaries between art and design, product development, political activism, and communication, Internet Art shows how artists have employed online technologies to engage with the traditions of art history, to create new forms of art, and to move into fields of activity normally beyond the artistic realm. The book investigates the ways Internet art resists and shifts assumptions about authorship, originality, and intellectual property; the social role of the artist; issues of identity, sexuality, economics, and power; and the place of the individual in the virtual, networked age. Throughout, the views of artists, curators, and critics offer an insider's perspective on the subject, while a timeline and glossary provide easy-to-follow guides to the key works, events, and technological developments that have taken art into the twenty-first century.},

  abstract = {Winner of a 2013 CHOICE Outstanding Academic Title Award ~ The third edition of a groundbreaking reference, The Human–Computer Interaction Handbook: Fundamentals, Evolving Technologies, and Emerging Applications raises the bar for handbooks in this field. It is the largest, most complete compilation of HCI theories, principles, advances, case studies, and more that exist within a single volume. The book captures the current and emerging sub-disciplines within HCI related to research, development, and practice that continue to advance at an astonishing rate. It features cutting-edge advances to the scientific knowledge base as well as visionary perspectives and developments that fundamentally transform the way in which researchers and practitioners view the discipline. New and Expanded Topics in the Third Edition:   HCI and global sustainability HCI in health care Social networks and social media Enterprise social computing Role of HCI in e-Government Role of creativity and cognition in HCI Naturalistic approach to evaluation, persuasion, and globalization  The chapter authors include experts from academia, industry, and government agencies from across the globe — all among the very best and most respected in their fields. The more than 80 tables, 400 figures, nearly 7,000 references, and four-page color insert combine to provide the single most comprehensive depiction of this field. Broad in scope, the book pays equal attention to the human side, the computer side, and the interaction of the two. This balanced, application-focused design coverage makes the book not only an excellent research guide but also an authoritative handbook for the practice of HCI and for education and training in HCI.},

A final section probes aspects of visual culture in such environments as the evolving museum, movie spectaculars, and "the virtual window."The contributors reject apocalyptic scenarios of media revolution, demonstrating instead that media transition is always a mix of tradition and innovation, an accretive process in which emerging and established systems interact, shift, and collude with one another.},

Without pre-supposing a knowledge of Greek or the Classics, he sets out to explain the ideas of Plato and Aristotle in the light of their predecessors rather than their successors, and to describe the characteristic features of the Greek way of thinking and outlook on the world. Thus The Greek Philosophers provides excellent background material for the general reader-as well as providing a firm basis for specialist studies},

It provides students with skills that will enable them to make productive use of computational techniques, including some of the tools and techniques of data science for using computation to model and interpret data. The book is based on an MIT course (which became the most popular course offered through MIT's OpenCourseWare) and was developed for use not only in a conventional classroom but in in a massive open online course (MOOC). This new edition has been updated for Python 3, reorganized to make it easier to use for courses that cover only a subset of the material, and offers additional material including five new chapters.Students are introduced to Python and the basics of programming in the context of such computational concepts and techniques as exhaustive enumeration, bisection search, and efficient approximation algorithms. Although it covers such traditional topics as computational complexity and simple algorithms, the book focuses on a wide range of topics not found in most introductory texts, including information visualization, simulations to model randomness, computational techniques to understand data, and statistical techniques that inform (and misinform) as well as two related but relatively advanced topics: optimization problems and dynamic programming. This edition offers expanded material on statistics and machine learning and new chapters on Frequentist and Bayesian statistics.},

In the first two, Kant dealt with metaphysics and morality; in the third, Kant turns to the aesthetic dimension of human experience, showing how our experiences of natural and artistic beauty, the sublime magnitude and might of nature, and of purposive organisms and ecological systems gives us palpable evidece that it is possible for us not only to form moral intentions, but also to realize our freely chosen moral goals within nature as we experience it. The present volume collects twelve of the most important critical discussions on the Critique of the Power of Judgment written by leading Kant scholars and aestheticians from the United States and Great Britain. In addition to a substantive introduction by the editor, the book includes an extensive, annotated bibliography of the most important work on Kant and on the background and arguments of his third Critique published throughout the twentieth century.},

As that organization changes, either violently or imperceptibly, so also the arts change by abrupt or gentle degrees. In the past these inevitable modifications took place according to a plan which we are now able to trace with some accuracy. We can see the connection of cause and effect; and predict, as it were, the consequences for art of this or that social revolution.But in our own day the relation of art to life seems vastly more complex and more obscure. The society of the whole world is being rearranged and the spiritual confusion created by these social, political, and economic events is reflected in the arts with a disconcerning obviousness. This is a period of drastic re-valuation and just as the pressure of external events compels us to decide wheather we can any longer support certain institution and practise certain modes of life, so it obliges us to review the arts without prejudice or sentiment and consider whether they correspond to our necessities. And that is the main idea of Josef Svoboda's scenography.This Study of Josef Svoboda and His Modern Scenography is an outgrowth of an acquaintance with Svoboda and his work. Svoboda is first and foremost a creative artist still actively engaged in his careet, working at home and abroad on six to twelve stage productions annually. Now in his seventies, he also remains artistic head of Laterna Magika, a production organization devoted to the creative interplay of live and filmed action.The primary intention of this study is to offer certain insight into the ways an unusually gifted, skilled, and productive contemporary scenographer function and the theoretical implication of his work, enriched by his observations on the principal concepts and techniques that have characterized his work. He let us in on the partly scientific, partly inspirational, phases of the collective art of theatre production that culminated.},

Compared to Paik’s fame in video art, his originality in interactive art was hardly examined in the history of new media art. This paper explores Random Access as a pioneering project in interactive art. Paik was educated in West Germany from 1956 to 1963. Based on his academia in the center of music, Paik published several music articles for .orean and Japanese readers as a foreign correspondent. According to his articles about progressive music in Europe, Paik was inspired by .arlheinz Stockhausen, Pierre Schaeffer and John Cage when he started to create his own interactive project. His specific articles about these experimental composers reveal that Random Access shows a long-time development of a diligent academic artist. As a history of interactive art, this study traces Paik’s unprecedented creation, which made a significant transition from music to interactive art.},

Contending that our forms of attention, observation, and truth are contingent and contested, Orit Halpern historicizes the ways that we are trained, and train ourselves, to observe and analyze the world. Tracing the postwar impact of cybernetics and the communication sciences on the social and human sciences, design, arts, and urban planning, she finds a radical shift in attitudes toward recording and displaying information. These changed attitudes produced what she calls communicative objectivity: new forms of observation, rationality, and economy based on the management and analysis of data. Halpern complicates assumptions about the value of data and visualization, arguing that changes in how we manage and train perception, and define reason and intelligence, are also transformations in governmentality. She also challenges the paradoxical belief that we are experiencing a crisis of attention caused by digital media, a crisis that can be resolved only through intensified media consumption.},

In these works, including many science education and pedagogy films, the nature of the image, the materiality of vision, and the relationship between documentation and communication were being aggressively rethought. All these projects were deeply invested in the emergent terms of cybernetics and electronic media. Ontology, documentation, and representation were seemingly replaced by discourses of communication, performance, and modularity; the world as interface for the mediation of ongoing, lively communicative exchanges. The work of Charles and Ray Eames and Gyorgy Kepes provides evidence of a more global reformulation of the work of the document, the relationship between abstraction and materiality, and among science, aesthetics, and visuality.},

But, it is not argued that terms from Latour’s theory can be used to better understand contemporary art. Instead, the claim is that there is an equivalence between the way that Latour works and contemporary art practices. I begin by giving an account of the conditions of art in terms of three categories, all of which are rendered ambiguous through contemporary practice: style/epoch, object, and medium. Next an account is given of Latour’s notable engagement with the art world and with artists. He finds in art a useful mode of inquiry that complements his own engagement with sociological and anthropological analysis. In conclusion, it is claimed that in contemporary artistic practices, historical and discursive distinctions between artistic and philosophical methods begin to blur. This establishes an equivalence between Latour’s practices and those of contemporary artists. In other words, Latour operates just like a contemporary artist, that is, by using strategies to rethink the world, its structures, and relations that are, at heart, aesthetic strategies.},

In others words, the question of what is being done by the artwork cannot be answered without answering what the agency for that action is. First, I introduce the problem of medium in art after modernism. I argue that the terms ‘end of art’, ‘postmodern’ and ‘postmedium’ are commensurate, and that all require a rethinking of concept of medium in art practice. I then argue that Niklas Luhmann’s account of medium (in his sociologically grounded systems theory) provides an answer to the question: What Work Does the Work of Art Do? My argument is that the work of art gives the medium form, configures it and thus actively constitutes it as a medium. As a concluding example, I turn to Pierre Huyghe and Phillipe Parreno’s collaborative project No Ghost Just a Shell (1999–2002) and demonstrate how Luhmann’s account of medium/form can be used to explain the work.},

  journal = {CHArt},
  abstract = {This paper takes the forthcoming exhibition, 'Open Systems: Rethinking Art c.1970,' at Tate Modern (1.) as a starting point for a discussion on how to theorise 'systems-art.' Systems-art emerged in the 1960s and 1970s as a new paradigm in artistic practice. Such art is characterised by the following: artistic responses to new technologies, the use of so-called New Media (including computer art), the emergence of digital and network art, and an interest in a systems-aesthetic. I argue that such artistic practice presents particular problems to established art-historical methods, and that the emergence of these problems is two-fold. The wide variety of 'systems-art,' or that which explores the systems-aesthetic, includes the following characteristics: an interest in the aesthetics of networks, the exploitation of new technology and New Media, unstable or de-materialised physicality, the prioritising of non-visual aspects, and an engagement (often politicised) with the institutional systems of support (such as the gallery, discourse, or the market) within which it occurs. These characteristics often manifest themselves in the challenge which such art presents to Modernist paradigms of art-making and identity. Art History as it is commonly practiced, remains largely structurally unaltered since its Modernist foundations as an autonomous discipline in the nineteenth century. It therefore focuses its attentions primarily upon singular objects, and provides accounts of these objects in predominantly visual terms. I argue that it is therefore insufficient to deal with the ambiguities and complexities of 'systems-art.' Having introduced, via specific examples, some key concepts of 'systems-art'. I then argue that systems-theory, exemplified by that of German sociologist Niklas Luhmann, provides an effective theoretical model to account for such art. This is because it shifts its attention from singular objects to the systems from which art emerges. These include systems of display, exchange, discursive systems and artworks themselves which display systemic qualities. In particular I will introduce the systems-theoretical vocabularies of Emergence, Complexity and (systems-contingent) Observation as they are discussed by Luhmann and demonstrate their application to the complexity of 'systems-art'. 1. ‘Open Systems: Rethinking Art c.1970,’ is at Tate Modern from 1 June to 18 September 2005 and is curated by Donna De Salvo.

  abstract = {Rediscovering Aesthetics brings together prominent international voices from art history, philosophy, and artistic practice to discuss the current role of aesthetics within and across their disciplines.  Following a period in which theories and histories of art, art criticism, and artistic practice seemed to focus exclusively on political, social, or empirical interpretations of art, aesthetics is being rediscovered both as a vital arena for discussion and a valid interpretive approach outside its traditional philosophical domain. This volume is distinctive, because it provides a selection of significant but divergent positions. The diversity of the views presented here demonstrates that a critical rethinking of aesthetics can be undertaken in a variety of (possibly incompatible) ways. The contributions open a transdisciplinary debate from which a new field of aesthetics may begin to emerge. Contributors include: Claire Bishop, Diarmuid Costello, Paul Crowther, Arthur Danto, Nicholas Davey, Thierry de Duve, James Elkins, Francis Halsall, Michael Ann Holly, Julia Jansen, Michael Kelly, Robert Morris, Tony O'Connor, Peter Osborne, Adrian Piper, David Raskin, Carolee Schneemann, Richard Shiff, Wolfgang Welsch, and Richard Woodfield.},

While Paik gradually developed interactive sound art in West Germany, he wrote several articles about contemporary music in Europe. Specifically, a musique concrète article for Korean readers is significant as a seed of his interactive projects. This study examines the content of the music article and articulates the relationship between musique concrète and Paik’s interactive sound projects: Record Shashlik (1963) and Random Access (1963).},

(…) 눈을 감고 있던 외할머니의 얼굴에서 새 같은 무언가가 문득 빠져 나갔다. 순식간에 주검이 된 주름진 얼굴을 보며, 그 어린 새 같은 것이 어디로 가버렸는지 몰라 너는 멍하게 서 있었다. 지금 상무관에 있는 사람들의 혼도 갑자기 새처럼 몸을 빠져나갔을까. 놀란 그 새들은 어디 있을까.\_ 본문 중에서혼은 자기 몸 곁에 얼마나 오래 머물러 있을까. 그게 무슨 날개같이 파닥이기도 할까. 촛불의 가장자릴 흔들리게 할까. (…) 용서하지 않을 거다. (…) 아무것도 용서하지 않을 거다. 나 자신까지도.\_ 본문 중에서억울한 영혼들의 말을 대신 전하는 오월의 노래정대는 동호와 함께 시위대의 행진 도중 계엄군이 쏜 총에 맞아 쓰러져 죽게 되고, 중학교를 마치기 전에 공장에 들어와 자신의 꿈을 미루고 동생을 뒷바라지하던 정대의 누나 정미 역시 그 봄에 행방불명되면서 남매는 비극을 맞는다. 무자비한 국가의 폭력이 한순간에 무너뜨린 순박한 사람들의 평범한 일상과 무고하게 죽은 어린 생명들에 대한 억울함과 안타까움이 정대의 절규하는 듯한 목소리로 대변된다. 5·18 당시, 인구 40만의 광주 시민들을 진압하기 위해 군인들이 지급받은 탄환은 80만발이었다고 전해진다. 이런 엄혹한 분위기 속에서도 국가의 부조리에 맞서도록 어린 그들까지 시위현장으로 이끌었던 강렬한 힘은 다만 ‘깨끗하고도 무서운 양심’ 하나였다. 그렇게 아이들은 ‘세상에서 가장 거대하고 숭고한 심장의 맥박’을 느끼며 수십만 시민들이 모여 만든 위대한 ‘양심의 혈관’을 함께 이루었던 것이다. 키가 자라고 싶었지. 팔굽혀펴기를 마흔번 연달아 하고 싶었지. 언젠가 여자를 안아보고 싶었지. 나에게 처음으로 허락될 여자, 얼굴을 모르는 그 여자의 심장 언저리에 떨리는 손을 얹고 싶었지. (…) 차디찬 방아쇠를 생각해./그걸 당긴 따뜻한 손가락을 생각해./나를 조준한 눈을 생각해./쏘라고 명령한 사람의 눈을 생각해.//그들의 얼굴을 보고 싶다, 잠든 그들의 눈꺼풀 위로 어른거리고 싶다, 꿈속으로 불쑥 들어가고 싶다, 그 이마, 그 눈꺼풀들을 밤새 건너다니며 어른거리고 싶다. 그들이 악몽 속에서 피 흐르는 내 눈을 볼 때까지. 내 목소리를 들을 때까지. 왜 나를 쐈지, 왜 나를 죽였지. \_ 본문 중에서그날 도청에 남은 어린 친구들도 아마 비슷한 경험을 했을 겁니다. 그 양심의 보석을 죽음과 맞바꿔도 좋다고 판단했을 겁니다. 하지만 이제는 아무것도 확신할 수 없습니다. 총을 메고 창 아래 웅크려앉아 배가 고프다고 말하던 아이들, 소회의실에 남은 카스텔라와 환타를 얼른 가져와 먹어도 되느냐고 묻던 아이들이, 죽음에 대해서 뭘 알고 그런 선택을 했겠습니까?\_ 본문 중에서소설은 동호와 함께 상무관에서 일하던 형과 누나들이 겪은 5·18 전후의 삶의 모습을 통해 대한민국 근현대사의 비극적인 단면들을 드러내 보이고 있다. 살아 있다는 것이 오히려 치욕스러운 고통이 되거나 일상을 회복할 수 없는 무력감에 괴로워하는 이들의 모습은 35년이 지난 지금도 현재진행형으로 이어지고 있다. 당시 수피아여고 3학년 시절에 5·18을 겪은 ‘김은숙’은 \&\#39;전두환 타도\&\#39;를 외치는 데모로 점철된 대학생활을 포기하고 작은 출판사에서 편집자로 일하면서 담당 원고의 검열 문제로 서대문경찰서에 끌려가 ‘일곱대의 뺨’을 맞기도 한다. 봉제공장에서 일을 하면서 ‘고귀한 우리’ 자신을 지키기 위해 노조활동을 하다 쫓겨난 ‘임선주’는 이후 양장점에서 일을 하다가 상무관에 합류하게 되고, 경찰에 연행된 후 하혈이 멈추지 않는 끔찍한 고문을 당한다. 상무관에서 활발하게 활동하던 대학생 ‘김진수’ 역시 연행된 이후 ‘모나미 볼펜’ 고문, 성기 고문 등을 받으며 끔찍한 수감생활을 했고, 출소 후 트라우마로 고통받다 결국 자살하고 만다. 소설은 이러한 국가의 무자비함을 핍진하게 그려내면서 ‘유전자에 새겨진 듯 동일한 잔인성’으로 과거뿐 아니라 지금까지도, 우리나라뿐 아니라 전세계에서 끊임없이 자행되고 있는 인간의 잔혹함과 악행에 대한 근원적인 질문을 던진다. 그다음 문단은 검열 때문에 온전히 책에 실리지 못했다. 그렇다면 우리에게 남는 질문은 이것이다. 인간은 무엇인가. 인간이 무엇이지 않기 위해 우리는 무엇을 해야 하는가. 이어서 먹선으로 지워진 넉줄의 문장들을 그녀는 기억했다. (…) 그녀는 인간을 믿지 않았다. 어떤 표정, 어떤 진실, 어떤 유려한 문장도 완전하게 신뢰하지 않았다. 오로지 끈질긴 의심과 차가운 질문들 속에서 살아 나아가야 한다는 것을 알았다.\_ 본문 중에서처음 자료를 접하며 가장 이해할 수 없었던 것은, 연행할 목적도 아니면서 반복적으로 저질러진 살상들이었다. 죄의식도 망설임도 없는 한낮의 폭력. 그렇게 잔인성을 발휘하도록 격려하고 명령했을 지휘관들. (…) 저건 광주잖아. 그러니까 광주는 고립된 것, 힘으로 짓밟힌 것, 훼손된 것, 훼손되지 말았어야 했던 것의 다른 이름이었다. 피폭이 아직 끝나지 않았다. 광주가 수없이 되태어나 살해되었다. 덧나고 폭발하며 피투성이로 재건되었다.\_ 본문 중에서‘꽃이 핀 쪽으로’이끌어주는 한강의 손길한강은 이번 소설을 통해 ‘살아남았다’는 것이 오히려 치욕이 되는 사람들이 혼자서 힘겹게 견뎌내야 하는 매일을 되새기며, 그들의 아물지 않는 기억들을 함께 나눈다. 한강 작가는 “무덥고 습했던 여름 끝에 가로수 아래를 걷다가, 잘 마른 깨끗한 홑청 같은 바람이 얼굴과 팔에 감기는 감각에 놀라며 동호를 생각”한다. 따뜻했던 봄날의 오월을 지나 ‘그 여름을 건너가지 못한 동호, 이런 아침을 다시는 만나지 못하는 동호’를 떠올리며 작가는 우리가 ‘날마다 만나는 모든 이들이 인간이란 것을’ 되새기고, 인간으로서의 우리가 이들에게 어떠한 대답을 해줄 수 있는가를 간절한 목소리로 묻는다. 그리하여 이제는 더이상 억울한 영혼들이 없기를, 상처 입은 영혼들이 “밝은 쪽으로, 빛이 비치는 쪽으로, 꽃이 핀 쪽으로” 나아가 평온할 수 있기를 기도한다. 5·18 희생자들의 ‘눈 덮인 무덤들’ 사이에서 못다 핀 소년 동호를 추모하기 위해 작가 한강이 마음을 다해 밝힌 작은 촛불들이 안타까운 세상에 온기를 더해줄 것이다. 당신들을 잃은 뒤, 우리들의 시간은 저녁이 되었습니다. 우리들의 집과 거리가 저녁이 되었습니다. 더이상 어두워지지도, 다시 밝아지지도 않는 저녁 속에서 우리들은 밥을 먹고, 걸음을 걷고 잠을 잡니다.\_ 본문 중에서당신이 죽은 뒤 장례식을 치르지 못해, 내 삶이 장례식이 되었습니다.\_본문 중에서추천사어둠과 폭력의 세계 속에 상처 입은 존재들을 섬세하게 그려온 한강의 소설이 5월 광주의 시공간에서 벌어진 잔혹한 학살의 참상과 정면으로 마주한다. 증언하는 자의 소명의식과 듣는 자의 상상력이 치열하게 어우러지는 간절한 고백의 서사는 잊을 수 없는 ‘그 도시의 열흘’을 고통스럽게 되살린다. 물방울이 내쏘는 햇빛의 파편에도 눈이 시린 순결한 ‘어린 새’의 흔적을 쫓는 이 소설은 우리가 ‘붙들어야 할’ 역사적 기억이 무엇인지를 절실하게 환기하고 있다. \_ 백지연 문학평론가 어떤 소재는 그것을 택하는 일 자체가 작가 자신의 표현 역량을 시험대에 올리는 일일 수 있다. 한국문학사에서 ‘80년 5월 광주’는 여전히 그러할 뿐 아니라 가장 그러한 소재다. 다만 이제 더 절실한 것은 역사적 사실에 근거한 응징과 복권의 서사이기보다는 상처의 구조에 대한 투시와 천착의 서사일 것인데, 이를 통해 한국문학의 인간학적 깊이가 심화될 여지는 아직 많다. ＜소년이 온다＞는 한강이 쓴 광주 이야기라면 읽는 쪽에서도 마음의 준비가 필요하겠다고 각오한 사람조차 휘청거리게 만든다. 이 소설은 그날 파괴된 영혼들이 못다 한 말들을 대신 전하고, 그 속에서 한 사람이 자기파괴를 각오할 때만 도달할 수 있는 인간 존엄의 위대한 증거를 찾아내는데, 시적 초혼과 산문적 증언을 동시에 감행하는, 파울 첼란과 쁘리모 레비가 함께 쓴 것 같은 문장들은 거의 원망스러울 만큼 정확한 표현으로 읽는 이를 고통스럽게 한다. 5월 광주에 대한 소설이라면 이미 나올 만큼 나오지 않았느냐고, 또 이런 추천사란 거짓은 아닐지라도 대개 과장이 아니냐고 의심할 사람들에게, 나는 입술을 깨물면서 둘 다 아니라고 단호히 말할 것이다. 이것은 한강을 뛰어넘은 한강의 소설이다. \_ 신형철 문학평론가    Changbi Publishers},

  abstract = {This book offers an interdisciplinary, historically grounded study of Asian cinemas’ complex responses to the Cold War conflict. It situates the global ideological rivalry within regional and local political, social, and cultural processes, while offering a transnational and cross-regional focus. This volume makes a major contribution to constructing a cultural and popular cinema history of the global Cold War. Its geographical focus is set on East Asia, Southeast Asia, and South Asia. In adopting such an inclusive approach, it draws attention to the different manifestations and meanings of the connections between the Cold War and cinema across Asian borders. Many essays in the volume have a transnational and cross-regional focus, one that sheds light on Cold War-influenced networks (such as the circulation of socialist films across communist countries) and on the efforts of American agencies (such as the United States Information Service and the Asia Foundation) to establish a transregional infrastructure of "free cinema" to contain the communist influences in Asia. With its interdisciplinary orientation and broad geographical focus, the book will appeal to scholars and students from a wide variety of fields, including film studies, history (especially the burgeoning field of cultural Cold War studies), Asian studies, and US-Asian cultural relations.},

In the course of discussing all the facets of neoliberal psychopolitics fueling our contemporary crisis of freedom, Han elaborates an analytical framework that provides an original theory of Big Data and a lucid phenomenology of emotion. But this provocative essay proposes counter models too, presenting a wealth of ideas and surprising alternatives at every turn.},

  abstract = {Even as media in myriad forms increasingly saturate our lives, we nonetheless tend to describe our relationship to it in terms from the twentieth century: we are consumers of media, choosing to engage with it. In~Feed-Forward, Mark B. N. Hansen shows just how outmoded that way of thinking is: media is no longer separate from us but has become an inescapable part of our very experience of the world. Drawing on the speculative empiricism of philosopher Alfred North Whitehead, Hansen reveals how new media call into play elements of sensibility that greatly affect human selfhood without in any way~belonging~to the human. From social media to data-mining to new sensor technologies, media in the twenty-first century work largely outside the realm of perceptual consciousness, yet at the same time inflect our every sensation. Understanding that paradox, Hansen shows, offers us a chance to put forward a radically new vision of human becoming, one that enables us to reground the human in a non-anthropocentric view of the world and our experience in it.},

Both schools of thought approach the ostensible objectivity of the visible world through a deconstructed and personalized interpretation made possible by our perception. Especially in regard to aesthetics, our perceptual biases enable an agency through which everyone can participate and ultimately enrich the dialogue that provisions art with meaning. Diagrams of eye-tracking studies inspired by early Situationist graphics highlight the piecemeal and constructive nature of our perception. In the context of unprecedented AI image generation, with aesthetic creativity itself being questioned, the text offers a graphic-based reminder of the value and creativity of our perception.},

The world is on the verge of ecological collapse. Misinformation abounds. And we are rushing headlong into the age of AI-a new information network that threatens to annihilate us. For all that we have accomplished, why are we so self-destructive? Nexus looks through the long lens of human history to consider how the flow of information has shaped us, and our world. Taking us from the Stone Age, through the canonization of the Bible, early modern witch-hunts, Stalinism, Nazism, and the resurgence of populism today, Yuval Noah Harari asks us to consider the complex relationship between information and truth, bureaucracy and mythology, wisdom and power. He explores how different societies and political systems throughout history have wielded information to achieve their goals, for good and ill. And he addresses the urgent choices we face as non-human intelligence threatens our very existence"--},

  abstract = {The world-renowned authors of the international best-seller Empire follow with an astonishing, politically energizing manifesto that argues that some of the most troubling aspects of the new world order contain the seeds of radical global social transformation  With Empire, Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri established themselves as visionary theoreticians of the new global order. They presented a profound new vision of a world in which the old system of nation-states has surrendered much of its hegemony to a supranational, multidimensional network of power they call empire. Empire penetrates into more aspects of life over more of the world than any traditional empire before it, and it cannot be beheaded for it is multinoded. The network is the empire and the empire is the network.  Now, in Multitude, Hardt and Negri offer up an inspiring vision of how the people of the world can use the structures of empire against empire itself. With the enormous intellectual depth, historical perspective, and positive, enabling spirit that are the authors' hallmark, Multitude lays down in three parts a powerful case for hope. Part I, "War," examines the darkest aspects of empire. We are at a crisis point in human affairs, when the new circuits of power have grown beyond the ability of existing circuits of political sovereignty and social justice to contain them. A mind-set of perpetual war predominates in which all wars are police actions and all police actions are wars-counterinsurgencies against the enemies of empire. In Part II, the book's central section, "Multitude," they explain how empire, by colonizing and interconnecting more areas of human life ever more deeply, has actually created the possibility for democracy of a sort never before seen. Brought together in a multinoded commons of resistance, different groups combine and recombine in fluid new matrices of resistance. No longer the silent, oppressed "masses," they form a multitude. Hardt and Negri argue that the accelerating integration of economic, social, political, and cultural forces into a complex network they call the biopolitical is actually the most radical step in the liberation of humankind since the Industrial Revolution broke up the old feudal order. Finally, in "Democracy," the authors put forward their agenda for how the global multitude can form a robust biopolitical commons in which democracy can truly thrive on a global scale. Exhilarating in its ambition, range, and depth of interpretive insight, Multitude consolidates Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri's stature as the most exciting and important political philosophers at work in the world today.},

  abstract = {A powerful new theory of human nature suggests that our secret to success as a species is our unique~friendliness“Brilliant, eye-opening, and absolutely inspiring—and a riveting read. Hare and Woods have written the perfect book for our time.”—Cass R. Sunstein, author of~How Change Happens~and co-author of~Nudge For most of the approximately 300,000 years that Homo sapiens have existed, we have shared the planet with at least four other types of humans. All of these were smart, strong, and inventive. But around 50,000 years ago, Homo sapiens made a cognitive leap that gave us an edge over other species. What happened? Since Charles Darwin wrote about “evolutionary fitness,” the idea of fitness has been confused with physical strength, tactical brilliance, and aggression. In fact, what made us evolutionarily fit was a remarkable kind of friendliness, a virtuosic ability to coordinate and communicate with others that allowed us to achieve all the cultural and technical marvels in human history. Advancing what they call the “self-domestication theory,” Brian Hare, professor in the department of evolutionary anthropology and the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience at Duke University and his wife, Vanessa Woods, a research scientist and award-winning journalist, shed light on the mysterious leap in human cognition that allowed Homo sapiens to thrive.~ But this gift for friendliness came at a cost. Just as a mother bear is most dangerous around her cubs, we are at our most dangerous when someone we love is threatened by an “outsider.” The threatening outsider is demoted to sub-human, fair game for our worst instincts. Hare’s groundbreaking research, developed in close coordination with Richard Wrangham and Michael Tomasello, giants in the field of cognitive evolution, reveals that the same traits that make us the most tolerant species on the planet also make us the cruelest.~  Survival of the Friendliest offers us a new way to look at our cultural as well as cognitive evolution and sends a clear message: In order to survive and even to flourish, we need to expand our definition of who belongs.},

Is a specific Pizza Hut restaurant as real as the employees, tables, napkins and pizzas of which it is composed, and as real as the Pizza Hut corporation with its headquarters in Wichita, the United States, the planet Earth and the social and economic impact of the restaurant on the lives of its employees and customers? In this book the founder of object-oriented philosophy develops his approach in order to shed light on the nature and status of objects in social life. While it is often assumed that an interest in objects amounts to a form of materialism, Harman rejects this view and develops instead an “immaterialist” method. By examining the work of leading contemporary thinkers such as Bruno Latour and Levi Bryant, he develops a forceful critique of ‘actor-network theory’. In an extended discussion of Leibniz’s famous example of the Dutch East India Company, Harman argues that this company qualifies for objecthood neither through ‘what it is’ or ‘what it does’, but through its irreducibility to either of these forms. The phases of its life, argues Harman, are not demarcated primarily by dramatic incidents but by moments of symbiosis, a term he draws from the biologist Lynn Margulis. This book provides a key counterpoint to the now ubiquitous social theories of constant change, holistic networks, performative identities, and the construction of things by human practice. It will appeal to anyone interested in cutting-edge debates in philosophy and social and cultural theory.},

But as Graham Harman, one of the theory's leading exponents, shows, Object-Oriented Ontology (OOO) rejects the idea of human specialness: the world, he states, is clearly not the world as manifest to humans. "To think a reality beyond our thinking is not nonsense, but obligatory." At OOO's heart is the idea that objects—whether real, fictional, natural, artificial, human, or non-human—are mutually autonomous. This core idea has significance for nearly every field of inquiry which is concerned in some way with the systematic interaction of objects, and the degree to which individual objects resist full participation in such systems. In this brilliant new introduction, Graham Harman lays out OOO's history, ideas, and impact, taking in art and literature, politics and natural science along the way.~From Sherlock Holmes, unicorns, and videogames to Dadaism, Voltaire, and string theory, this book will change the way you understand everything.},

  abstract = {In  \&lt;I\&gt;Phantasmal Media\&lt;/I\&gt;, D. Fox Harrell considers the expressive power of computational media. He argues, forcefully and persuasively, that the great expressive potential of computational media comes from the ability to construct and reveal phantasms -- blends of cultural ideas and sensory imagination. These ubiquitous and often-unseen phantasms -- cognitive phenomena that include sense of self, metaphors, social categories, narrative, and poetic thinking -- influence almost all our everyday experiences. Harrell offers an approach for understanding and designing computational systems that have the power to evoke these phantasms, paying special attention to the exposure of oppressive phantasms and the creation of empowering ones. He argues for the importance of cultural content, diverse worldviews, and social values in computing. The expressive power of phantasms is not purely aesthetic, he contends; phantasmal media can express and construct the types of meaning central to the human condition.Harrell discusses, among other topics, the phantasm as an orienting perspective for developers; expressive epistemologies, or data structures based on subjective human worldviews; morphic semiotics (building on the computer scientist Joseph Goguen's theory of algebraic semiotics); cultural phantasms that influence consensus and reveal other perspectives; computing systems based on cultural models; interaction and expression; and the ways that real-world information is mapped onto, and instantiated by, computational data structures.The concept of phantasmal media, Harrell argues, offers new possibilities for using the computer to understand and improve the human condition through the human capacity to imagine.},

Yet vast narratives--featuring an ongoing and intricately developed storyline, many characters, and multiple settings--did not originate with, and are not limited to, Massively Multiplayer Online Games. Thomas Mann's Joseph and His Brothers, J. R. R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, Marvel's Spiderman, and the complex stories of such television shows as Dr. Who, The Sopranos, and Lost all present vast fictional worlds. Third Person explores strategies of vast narrative across a variety of media, including video games, television, literature, comic books, tabletop games, and digital art. The contributors--media and television scholars, novelists, comic creators, game designers, and others--investigate such issues as continuity, canonicity, interactivity, fan fiction, technological innovation, and cross-media phenomena. Chapters examine a range of topics, including storytelling in a multiplayer environment; narrative techniques for a 3,000,000-page novel; continuity (or the impossibility of it) in Doctor Who; managing multiple intertwined narratives in superhero comics; the spatial experience of the Final Fantasy role-playing games; World of Warcraft adventure texts created by designers and fans; and the serial storytelling of The Wire. Taken together, the multidisciplinary conversations in Third Person, along with Harrigan and Wardrip-Fruin's earlier collections First Person and Second Person, offer essential insights into how fictions are constructed and maintained in very different forms of media at the beginning of the twenty-first century.},

The result is both interesting art and new scientific innovations.Art and Innovation explores the unique process that grew from this pairing of new media artists and scientists working at the frontier of developing technologies. In addition to discussing specific works created during several long-term residencies, the artists and researchers reveal the similarities and differences in their approaches and perspectives as they engage each other in a search for new methods for communication and creativity.Contributors : Marshall Bern, David Biegelsen, Michael Black, Jeanette Blomberg, John Seely Brown, Margaret Crane, Paul De Marinis, Jeanne C.

It sets out to describe and evaluate the development of new forms of art patronage and display evident in such recurrent events as biennials, ‘cultural quarter’ projects for urban regeneration, novel galleries of contemporary art, and production sponsors (such as the Saatchi Gallery and the Baltic). The scope of the collection is international and its aim is to map and examine the globalisation of art’s political-economy.

Jonathan Harris examines and accounts for the new approaches to the study of art which have been grouped loosely under the term "the new art history." He distinguishes between these and earlier forms of "radical" or "critical" analysis, explores the influence of other disciplines and traditions on art history, and relates art historical ideas and values to social change. Structured around an examination of key texts by major contemporary critics, including Griselda Pollock, Fred Orton, Albert Boime, Alan Wallach and Laura Mulvey, each chapter discusses a key moment in the discipline of art history, tracing the development and interaction of Marxist, feminist and psychoanalytic critical theories. Individual chapters include: Capitalist Modernity, the Nation-State and Visual Representation; Feminism, Art, and ArtHistory; Subjects, Identities and Visual Ideology; Structures and Meanings in Art and Society; and The Representation of Sexuality.},

The book seeks to expand the concept of traditional usability to a broader notion of user experience; to provide a hands-on, practical guide to best practices and established principles in a UX lifecycle; and to describe a pragmatic process for managing the overall development effort. The book provides an iterative and evaluation-centered UX lifecycle template, called the Wheel, for interaction design. Key concepts discussed include contextual inquiry and analysis; extracting interaction design requirements; constructing design-informing models; design production; UX goals, metrics, and targets; prototyping; UX evaluation; the interaction cycle and the user action framework; and UX design guidelines. This book will be useful to anyone interested in learning more about creating interaction designs to ensure a quality user experience. These include interaction designers, graphic designers, usability analysts, software engineers, programmers, systems analysts, software quality-assurance specialists, human factors engineers, cognitive psychologists, cosmic psychics, trainers, technical writers, documentation specialists, marketing personnel, and project managers.A very broad approach to user experience through its components-usability, usefulness, and emotional impact with special attention to lightweight methods such as rapid UX evaluation techniques and an agile UX development processUniversal applicability of processes, principles, and guidelines-not just for GUIs and the Web, but for all kinds of interaction and devices: embodied interaction, mobile devices, ATMs, refrigerators, and elevator controls, and even highway signageExtensive design guidelines applied in the context of the various kinds of affordances necessary to support all aspects of interactionReal-world stories and contributions from accomplished UX practitionersA practical guide to best practices and established principles in UXA lifecycle template that can be instantiated and tailored to a given project, for a given type of system development, on a given budget},

It is intended for engineers and product designers, which require design parameters not included in the current state of the art. Topics addressed are the preposition of hypotheses, the selection of parameters, psychophysical measurement procedures and the calculation of sample sizes. Relevant steps for data analysis from psychology and social sciences are applied to the engineering and design context and guidelines for reporting results are given. The required steps are illustrated with an example experiment assessing detection thresholds of damping parameters of haptic automotive rotary controls with regard to parameters like knob diameter and distraction. Results imply significant effects of knob diameter on both absolute and differential thresholds, but no effect of distraction, implying a good transferability of laboratory results to real-world applications.},

  abstract = {Mind design is the endeavor to understand mind (thinking, intellect) in terms of its design (how it is built, how it works). Unlike traditional empirical psychology, it is more oriented toward the "how" than the "what." An experiment in mind design is more likely to be an attempt to build something and make it work-as in artificial intelligence-than to observe or analyze what already exists. Mind design is psychology by reverse engineering. When Mind Designwas first published in 1981, it became a classic in the then-nascent fields of cognitive science and AI. This second edition retains four landmark essays from the first, adding to them one earlier milestone (Turing's "Computing Machinery and Intelligence") and eleven more recent articles about connectionism, dynamical systems, and symbolic versus nonsymbolic models. The contributors are divided about evenly between philosophers and scientists. Yet all are "philosophical" in that they address fundamental issues and concepts; and all are "scientific" in that they are technically sophisticated and concerned with concrete empirical research.

We see how they tried to expand our understanding, from Pavlov and his dogs to Milgram and his famous electric shock experiments to the CIA's secret mind-control projects. Hayes explores key concepts like child development, the inferiority complex, and PTSD and shows how psychological research has been used for both good and ill.{$<$}BR /{$>$} {$<$}BR /{$>$} This...},

  abstract = {In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content: Configurations 10.2 (2002) 297-320 Dualistic thinking is as difficult to avoid as the sticky clay that passes for topsoil where I live in Topanga Canyon. When it gets even a little wet, it attacks my feet so resolutely that I look as if I am wearing snowshoes. I try to avoid it, of course, but inevitably something lures me off the beaten path and there I am again, stomping around with elephant shoes. In similar fashion I struggled to avoid the Cartesian mind-body split in my recent book How We Became Posthuman when I made a distinction between the body and embodiment. The body, I suggested, is an abstract concept that is always culturally constructed. Regardless of how it is imagined, "the body" generalizes from a group of samples and in this sense always misses someone's particular body, which necessarily departs in greater or lesser measure from the culturally constructed norm. At the other end of the spectrum lie our experiences of embodiment. While these experiences are also culturally constructed, they are not entirely so, for they emerge from the complex interactions between conscious mind and the physiological structures that are the result of millennia of biological evolution. The body is the human form seen from the outside, from a cultural perspective striving to make representations that can stand in for bodies in general. Embodiment is experienced from the inside, from the feelings, emotions, and sensations that constitute the vibrant living textures of our lives—all the more vibrant because we are only occasionally conscious of their humming vitality. I tried to stay on the holistic path by insisting that the body and embodiment are always dynamically interacting with one another. But having made the analytical distinction between the body and embodiment, I could not escape the dualistic thinking that clung to me regardless of my efforts to avoid it. I want now to construct the situation in a different way. This essay pushes beyond the position articulated at the end of How We Became Posthuman, where I argued that the erasure of embodiment characteristic of the history of cybernetics should not again be enacted as we move into the technoscientific formations I call the posthuman. Rather than beginning dualistically with body and embodiment, I propose instead to focus on the idea of relation and posit it as the dynamic flux from which both the body and embodiment emerge. Seeing entities emerging from specific kinds of interaction allows them to come into view not as static objects precoded and prevalued, but rather as the visible results of the dynamic on-goingness of the flux—which in itself can be neither good nor bad because it precedes these evaluations, serving as the source of everything that populates my perceived world, including the body and experiences of embodiment. Beginning with relation rather than preexisting entities changes everything. It enables us to see that embodied experience comes not only from the complex interplay between brain and viscera that Antonio R. Damasio compellingly describes in Descartes' Error: Emotion, Reason, and the Human Brain, but also from the constant engagement of our embodied interactions with the environment. Abstract ideas of the body likewise arise from the interplay between prevailing cultural formations and the beliefs, observations, and experiences that count as empirical evidence in a given society. In this view, embodiment and the body are emergent phenomena arising from the dynamic flux that we try to understand analytically by parsing it into such concepts as biology and culture, evolution and technology. These categories always come after the fact, however, emerging from a flux too complex, interactive, and holistic to be grasped as a thing in itself. To signify this emergent quality of the body and embodiment, I will adopt the term proposed by Mark Hansen to denote a similar unity, the mindbody. While a study of anatomy textbooks written across the centuries will confirm that ideas of the body change as the culture changes, it is less obvious that our experiences of embodiment also change. Refusing to grant embodiment a status prior to relation opens the possibility that changes in the environment (themselves emerging from systemic and organized changes in the flux...},

  abstract = {“How do we think?” N. Katherine Hayles poses this question at the beginning of this bracing exploration of the idea that we think through, with, and alongside media. As the age of print passes and new technologies appear every day, this proposition has become far more complicated, particularly for the traditionally print-based disciplines in the humanities and qualitative social sciences. With a rift growing between digital scholarship and its print-based counterpart, Hayles argues for contemporary technogenesis—the belief that humans and technics are coevolving—and advocates for what she calls comparative media studies, a new approach to locating digital work within print traditions and vice versa.Hayles examines the evolution of the field from the traditional humanities and how the digital humanities are changing academic scholarship, research, teaching, and publication. She goes on to depict the neurological consequences of working in digital media, where skimming and scanning, or “hyper reading,” and analysis through machine algorithms are forms of reading as valid as close reading once was. Hayles contends that we must recognize all three types of reading and understand the limitations and possibilities of each. In addition to illustrating what a comparative media perspective entails, Hayles explores the technogenesis spiral in its full complexity. She considers the effects of early databases such as telegraph code books and confronts our changing perceptions of time and space in the digital age, illustrating this through three innovative digital productions—Steve Tomasula’s electronic novel, TOC; Steven Hall’s The Raw Shark Texts; and Mark Z. Danielewski’s Only Revolutions.~Deepening our understanding of the extraordinary transformative powers digital technologies have placed in the hands of humanists, How We Think presents a cogent rationale for tackling the challenges facing the humanities today.},

It clearly distinguishes between the agential powers of material processes, which are the result of deterministic physico-chemical forces, and the capacities for choice, selection and novelty that all biological lifeforms exhibit. It argues that each lifeform has a characteristic Umwelt or worldview, created by the ways in which it processes internal and external information from the environment. The chapter extends this argument to computational media, which also have characteristic ways of responding to informational input and generating outputs. Acknowledging that at the level of logic gates computational media are almost completely deterministic, it shows how introducing pseudo-randomness and recursivity complicate computational programs, enabling them to produce evolutionary approximations for problems with no explicit solution. Finally, it explores the possibilities of contemporary neural nets based on transformer architectures, suggesting that the textual productions of these large models reflect the worldview of the programs and are appropriate objects for literary analysis.},

It includes a powerful reinterpretation of Greek thought, a sweeping vision of Western history, and a glimpse of the reasons behind Heidegger's support of the Nazi Party in the 1930s. Heidegger tries to reawaken the "question of Being" by challenging some of the most enduring prejudices embedded in Western philosophy and in our everyday practices and language. Furthermore, he relates this question to the insights of Greek tragedy into the human condition and to the political and cultural crises of modernity.This new translation makes this work more accessible to students than ever before. It combines smoothness with accuracy and provides conventional translations of Greek passages that Heidegger translated unconventionally. There are also extensive notes, a German-English glossary, and an introduction that discusses the history of the text, its basic themes, and its place in Heidegger's oeuvre.},

Although Duchamp talked of "Playful Physics" in his notes for the Glass, much of his humor and the breadth of his creative invention was obscured for later audiences when, after 1919, the popularization of relativity theory eclipsed the late Victorian ether physics that had fascinated the public in the early years of the century. Indeed, drawing upon contemporary science and technology, among other fields, Duchamp had created in the "Large Glass" a witty, multivalent commentary on the age-old theme of sexual desire, presented in the very newest verbal and visual languages. These ideas are explored in this article, reprinted from the conclusion of the author's book "Duchamp in Context: Science and Technology in the" Large Glass and Related Works."},

  abstract = {Communities of Sense argues for a new understanding of the relation between politics and aesthetics in today’s globalized and image-saturated world. Established and emerging scholars of art and culture draw on Jacques Rancière’s theorization of democratic politics to suggest that aesthetics, traditionally defined as the “science of the sensible,” is not a depoliticized discourse or theory of art, but instead part of a historically specific organization of social roles and communality. Rather than formulating aesthetics as the Other to politics, the contributors show that aesthetics and politics are mutually implicated in the construction of communities of visibility and sensation through which political orders emerge.The first of the collection’s three sections explicitly examines the links between aesthetics and social and political experience. Here a new essay by Rancière posits art as a key site where disagreement can be staged in order to produce new communities of sense. In the second section, contributors investigate how sense was constructed in the past by the European avant-garde and how it is mobilized in today’s global visual and political culture. Exploring the viability of various models of artistic and political critique in the context of globalization, the authors of the essays in the volume’s final section suggest a shift from identity politics and preconstituted collectivities toward processes of identification and disidentification. Topics discussed in the volume vary from digital architecture to a makeshift museum in a Paris suburb, and from romantic art theory in the wake of Hegel to the history of the group-subject in political art and performance since 1968. An interview with Étienne Balibar rounds out the collection.Contributors. Emily Apter, Étienne Balibar, Carlos Basualdo, T. J.

  abstract = {The results of artistic experimentation with data sets from the natural sciences differ considerably with respect to quality and consistency. The British artist duo Semiconductor (Ruth Jarman and Joe Gerhardt) counts among those setting the standard. In its animations and videos, it explores, in an equally multifaceted and concise manner, how scientists affect our world-view with their respective pictorial languages and visualization strategies. Especially in domains that elude our natural sense of space and time, the researchers’ representations are inevitably creative. Semiconductor combines everyday experiences and complex imaging techniques in manifold ways. Thus, they offer unseen and sometimes unorthodox interpretations of a world in constant flux while retaining a high degree of complexity in their subtly crafted works. Semiconductor’s works provide opportunities for reflection on the extensive procedures in the sciences on various levels and in doing so they create poetic pieces that shift and recombine in various ways. With these means, sensualized data – like sounds and images – take on a strong role in their time-based works. As operative entities they not only represent but they seem to act.},

  abstract = {A new conceptualization of the relationship between the systemic and the iconic in real-time simulations that distinguishes among four levels of forming.Computer simulations conceive objects and situations dynamically, in their changes and progressions. In The Systemic Image, Inge Hinterwaldner considers not only the technical components of dynamic computer simulations but also the sensory aspects of the realization. Examining the optic, the acoustic, the tactile, and the sensorimotor impressions that interactive real-time simulations provide, she finds that iconicity plays a dominant yet unexpected role. Based on this, and close readings of a series of example works, Hinterwaldner offers a new conceptualization of the relationship between systemic configuration and the iconic aspects in these calculated complexes.Hinterwaldner discusses specifications of sensorialization, necessary to make the simulation dynamic perceivable. Interweaving iconicity with simulation, she explores the expressive possibilities that can be achieved under the condition of continuously calculated explicit changes. She distinguishes among four levels of forming: the systems perspective, as a process and schema that establishes the most general framework of simulations; the mathematical model, which marks off the boundaries of the simulation's actualization; the iconization and its orientation toward the user; and interaction design, necessary for the full unfolding of the simulation. The user makes manifest what is initially latent. Viewing the simulation as an interface, Hinterwaldner argues that not only does the sensorially designed aspect of the simulation seduce the user but the user also makes an impact on the simulation―on the dynamic and perhaps on the iconization, although not on the perspectivation. The influence is reciprocal.},

  abstract = {“I want art to be life but it never can be.”  Hirst’s installation piece ‘In and Out of Love’ is made up of two works: ‘In and Out of Love (White Paintings and Live Butterflies)’ (1991); and ‘In and Out of Love (Butterfly Paintings and Ashtrays)’ (1991). They were united for the first time since their initial exhibition at Tate Modern’s ‘Damien Hirst’ retrospective in 2012. In 1991, just over a year after Hirst’s graduation from Goldsmiths, Tamara Chozdko organised an exhibition of the installation in an ex-travel agent’s office in Woodstock Street, London, in what proved to be one of the emerging artist’s most important early shows. The works were exhibited separately on two floors. In the humid upstairs space butterflies emerged from pupae attached to white painted canvases. Flowers and sugar water enabled the butterflies to feed, mate and lay eggs until they eventually died. Downstairs, butterfly monochrome paintings surrounded a table punctuated with overflowing ashtrays, the artist’s intention being to evoke the atmosphere of a private view. Positioned around the room were four large boxes, upscaled versions of those that contained the maggots in a ‘A Hundred Years’ (1990). The installation was described by Hirst as one of his most conceptually complicated works to date. He explains: “It’s about love and realism, dreams, ideals, symbols, life and death. I worked out many possible trajectories for these things, like the way the real butterfly can destroy the ideal (birthday-card) kind of love; the symbol exists apart from the real thing. Or the butterflies still being beautiful even when dead. All these things are completely thrown off balance by a comparison I tried to make between art and life, in the upstairs and downstairs installations, a crazy thing to do when in the end it’s all art.”[1] [1] Damien Hirst cited in ‘Damien Hirst \& Sophie Calle’, ‘Internal Affairs’ (Jay Jopling/ICA, 1991), unpag.},

This visual culture focusing on environmental deterioration represents a wider recognition of the political, economic, and cultural forces that are responsible for our ongoing environmental crisis. And yet efforts to raise awareness about environmental issues through digital and visual media are riddled with irony, because the resource extraction, manufacturing, transportation, and waste associated with digital devices contribute to environmental damage and climate change.  Screen Ecologies examines the relationship of media, art, and climate change in the Asia-Pacific region -- a key site of both environmental degradation and the production and consumption of climate-aware screen art and media. Screen Ecologies shows how new media and visual artists provide alternative ways for understanding the entanglements of media and the environment in the Asia-Pacific. It investigates such topics as artists' exploration of alternative ways to represent the environment; regional stories of media innovation and climate change; the tensions between amateur and professional art; the emergence of biennials, triennials, and new arts organizations; the theme of water in regional art; new models for networked collaboration; and social media's move from private to public realms.

For example, the French Revolution resulted in a restructuring of the French calendar, and the Soviet Union experimented with five and then six-day weeks.Leofranc Holford-Strevens brings us this fascinating study of time using a range of examples from Ancient Rome and Julius Caesar's imposition of the Leap Year to the 1920's project for a fixed Easter.  Those interested in time, history, and the development of the calendar will enjoy this absorbing exploration of an aspect of our lives that we all take for granted.},

  abstract = {The effects of new communication technologies on election campaigns, and the effectiveness of media-centered campaign strategies more broadly, remain ongoing subjects for debate in political science. This study provides some of the first empirical evidence about the potential impact of social media on the 2012 U.S. presidential elections, by testing the association between “candidate salience” and the candidates' level of engagement in online social media sphere. We define “candidate salience” as the extent to which candidates are discussed online by the public in an election campaign, and have selected the number of mentions presidential candidates receive on the social media site, Twitter, as means of quantifying their salience. This strategy allows us to examine whether social media, which is widely recognized as disruptive in the broader economic and social domains, has the potential to change the traditional dynamics of U.S. election campaigns. We find that while social media does substantially expand the possible modes and methods of election campaigning, high levels of social media activity on the part of presidential candidates have, as of yet, resulted in minimal effects on the amount of public attention they receive online.},

  month = apr,
  publisher = {The MIT Press},
  abstract = {In this book, Branden Hookway considers the interface not as technology but as a form of relationship with technology. The interface, Hookway proposes, is at once ubiquitous and hidden from view. It is both the bottleneck through which our relationship to technology must pass and a productive encounter embedded within the use of technology. It is a site of contestation -- between human and machine, between the material and the social, between the political and the technological -- that both defines and elides differences.  A virtuoso in multiple disciplines, Hookway offers a theory of the interface that draws on cultural theory, political theory, philosophy, art, architecture, new media, and the history of science and technology. He argues that the theoretical mechanism of the interface offers a powerful approach to questions of the human relationship to technology. Hookway finds the origin of the term interface in nineteenth-century fluid dynamics and traces its migration to thermodynamics, information theory, and cybernetics. He discusses issues of subject formation, agency, power, and control, within contexts that include technology, politics, and the social role of games. He considers the technological augmentation of humans and the human-machine system, discussing notions of embodied intelligence.  Hookway views the figure of the subject as both receiver and active producer in processes of subjectification. The interface, he argues, stands in a relation both alien and intimate, vertiginous and orienting to those who cross its threshold.},

This book sets out to provide the first concise interpretation of the period as a whole, clarifying the artists and their works along the way. Closely informed by new critical approaches, it concentrates on the relationship between American and European art from the end of the Second World War to the eve of the new millennium. Jackson Pollock, Jasper Johns, Yves Klein, Andy Warhol, Louise Bourgeois, Cindy Sherman, and Damien Hirst are among many artists discussed, with careful attention being given to the political and cultural worlds they inhabited. Moving along a clear timeline, the author highlights key movements such as Abstract Expressionism, Pop Art, Minimalism, Conceptualism, Postmodernism, and performance art to explain the theoretical and issue-based debates that have provided the engine for the art of this period.},

  abstract = {Dialectic of Enlightenment is undoubtedly the most influential publication of the Frankfurt School of Critical Theory. Written during the Second World War and circulated privately, it appeared in a printed edition in Amsterdam in 1947. "What we had set out to do," the authors write in the Preface, "was nothing less than to explain why humanity, instead of entering a truly human state, is sinking into a new kind of barbarism."Yet the work goes far beyond a mere critique of contemporary events. Historically remote developments, indeed, the birth of Western history and of subjectivity itself out of the struggle against natural forces, as represented in myths, are connected in a wide arch to the most threatening experiences of the present. The book consists in five chapters, at first glance unconnected, together with a number of shorter notes. The various analyses concern such phenomena as the detachment of science from practical life, formalized morality, the manipulative nature of entertainment culture, and a paranoid behavioral structure, expressed in aggressive anti-Semitism, that marks the limits of enlightenment. The authors perceive a common element in these phenomena, the tendency toward self-destruction of the guiding criteria inherent in enlightenment thought from the beginning. Using historical analyses to elucidate the present, they show, against the background of a prehistory of subjectivity, why the National Socialist terror was not an aberration of modern history but was rooted deeply in the fundamental characteristics of Western civilization.Adorno and Horkheimer see the self-destruction of Western reason as grounded in a historical and fateful dialectic between the domination of external nature and society. They trace enlightenment, which split these spheres apart, back to its mythical roots. Enlightenment and myth, therefore, are not irreconcilable opposites, but dialectically mediated qualities of both real and intellectual life. "Myth is already enlightenment, and enlightenment reverts to mythology." This paradox is the fundamental thesis of the book.This new translation, based on the text in the complete edition of the works of Max Horkheimer, contains textual variants, commentary upon them, and an editorial discussion of the position of this work in the development of Critical Theory.},

  abstract = {In a time in which an exuberant, trans-classical, non-trivial machine culture redesigns terminologies, remodels logics, produces new evidence, and reorganizes semantic resources, a new, neocybernetic regime of truth is taking shape. Many of our recent self-descriptions and theory formations are coined by our media-technological condition. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the work of Niklas Luhmann, especially in his inherent narrative of the history of rationality. This essay attempts to reconstruct Luhmann’s redescription of European rationality, especially the mediaand machine-historical conditions that remain apparent in Luhmann’s account. The decisive issue is that Luhmann’s history of rationality reveals the technological unconscious of systems theory and indeed the epochal imaginary it belongs to. With the help of the theories of machines developed by von Foerster, Simondon and Gu¨nther, Luhmann’s oeuvre must be read as probably the most striking conceptual edifice to emerge from what could be called the 20th-century’s epochal technological shift of meaning.},

Indeed it could be said that all history is colonial history, if one takes a broad enough definition and goes far enough back. And although the great historic imperial systems--the land-based Russian one as well as the seaborne empires of western European powers--have collapsed during the past half century, their legacies shape almost every aspect of life on a global scale. Meanwhile there is fierce argument, and much speculation, about what has replaced the old territorial empires in world politics. Do the United States and its allies, transnational companies, financial and media institutions, or more broadly the forces of "globalization", constitute a new imperial system?Stephen Howe interprets the meaning of the idea of "empire" through the ages, disentangling the multiple uses and abuses of the labels "empire" and "colonialism", etc., and examines the aftermath of imperialism on the contemporary world.},

In the new digital era of marketing communications little is known about how social media interactions with tourism brands affect how consumers think and feel about those brands, and consequently how those interactions affect desired marketing outcomes such as word mouth. Based on the literature, a conceptual model was developed and was tested using structural equation modeling. The results show that social media does indeed have a significant influence on emotions and attachments to festival brands, and that social media-based relationships lead to desired outcomes such as positive word of mouth.},

They are also a new kind of industrial object that pervades every aspect of our life today—as online videos, images, text files, e-mails, blog posts, Facebook events.Yet, despite their ubiquity, the nature of digital objects remains unclear.On the Existence of Digital Objects conducts a philosophical examination of digital objects and their organizing schema by creating a dialogue between Martin Heidegger and Gilbert Simondon, which Yuk Hui contextualizes within the history of computing. How can digital objects be understood according to individualization and individuation? Hui pursues this question through the history of ontology and the study of markup languages and Web ontologies; he investigates the existential structure of digital objects within their systems and milieux. With this relational approach toward digital objects and technical systems, the book addresses alienation, described by Simondon as the consequence of mistakenly viewing technics in opposition to culture.Interdisciplinary in philosophical and technical insights, with close readings of Husserl, Heidegger, and Simondon as well as the history of computing and the Web, Hui’s work develops an original, productive way of thinking about the data and metadata that increasingly define our world.},

  abstract = {This thoughtful and incisive guidebook, written by a former animator for Walt Disney Studios, will help artists at many skill levels improve their ability to draw a wide variety of animal forms both realistically and as caricatures. You'll learn why the author considers construction, action analysis, and caricature all-important for a clear understanding of animal anatomy and movement. You'll also benefit from Mr. Hultgren's expert advice and tips on catching the essential movement and character of animals and avoiding the stiff, wooden poses that are the frequent and unfortunate result of much sketching of animals from life. Throughout, the emphasis is on construction drawings (there are over 700 line illustrations and halftones) rather than on text. This means the student is able to view the development process of the drawing by example rather than theory or description. The book begins with introductory chapters on the special techniques of drawing animals, the use of line, establishing mood and feeling, conveying action, and brush techniques. Mr. Hultgren then turns to individual animal forms — horses, deer, cats, cows and bulls, giraffes, camels, gorillas, pigs, and many more. His instruction on animal caricature will be especially valuable to the legions of artists avidly interested in the subject. The Art of Animal Drawing belongs in the library of any artist — student, amateur, or professional — who is interested in drawing animals.},

  author = {Hyunkyoung, Cho},
  year = 2010,
  url = {http://www.riss.kr/link?id=T11922101},
  abstract = {Beauty is desire. The beauty is the desire performed in the action to object. The collaborative action of technology and human realizes the desire of beauty in the digital era. The human is the performing being determined by the will to action, and its condition is collaboration. The life is the actual-life process changed by the action and its mode of production. The essence of life is the multiplicity as the immanent inscription of event actualizing in the site of indeterminate situation. The multiplicity presents the truth-process, the multiple truths beyond what the truth is. It retains the freedom of human who follows the drive (Trieb) which circles perpetually round the desiring object. The technology expands the conception of beauty. In particular, the computational technology endowed with a certain degree of intelligent and emotional qualities performs the collaborative action with the human. The collaborative action of technology and human reverses the idealistic aesthetics that underlines the beauty in the regime of representation. The beauty performed in the collaborative action of technology and human can be called the performing beauty. It exists in the conflicting between desire and action in the relation to the object. It reveals that the object is the source of desire of beauty, insofar as the desire is the change of object in itself. It lasts the desire of beauty, the impossible demand organized in the actual and lived relation of the reality and the Real. Of special importance for understanding the performing beauty of collaborative action is the performative. The technology and human communicate using actions, and they act and react with each other. The process of collaborative action is parallel to that of conversation between humans. This implies that the collaborative action of technology and human is utterances including both the action itself and its result. It presents that the collaborative action of technology and human is a performance as what happens in the movement of action, and its meaning depends on the performativity as the felicity conditions (various communicative contexts) which can be, or not successful, rather than the truth condition can be true or false. What the performative of collaborative action means that the beauty prefers to infinitely open in the collaborative action rather than to complete in the given conventional contents. It becomes subject to the taste as style that is no longer so sure a reference point, and its judgment is in conformity with the power of desire rather than the power of reason. The performative of collaborative action is constituted by the total (Gesamt) and inter-action. The total-action is to merge technology and human into one insight in the name of life, and the inter-action is the netting (hybrid practice) based on the continuity and liminality: the continuity concerns with the coherence of mergers that give rise to new possibilities and liminality indicates threshold states, a moment of being in between altering phrases by the continuity. Two characteristics of total and inter-action weave a hybrid network of technology and human as collaborators on the equality. It reveals the ironic dream haunted by the fantasy-mechanism, the contemporary mass’s collective desire to technology. Insofar as the performative of collaborative action involves the relation of desire and action to object, it can be only observed by a symptom. Since the symptom is what is uttering as well as what should be read. To read the symptom, Aesthetic Technology analyzes the desire of beauty performed in the collaborative action of technology and human. In a narrow sense, Aesthetic Technology is a concept for the collaboration of technology and art (artistic usage of technology and technological usage of art). In a broad sense, Aesthetic Technology is an intervention on the absence of problems and concepts in the movement of critical analysis of the beauty provoked by the technology, and simultaneously the problematic of ideology that overlooks the significance of action to add something and the essential extra addition (the surplus value or enjoyment produced by the adding). What is revealed by Aesthetic Technology is the essential lack of being. It contributes to the real spirit of humanity which does not define ‘I’ but performs ‘We.’ It leads us to a truth: insofar as the human follows the rule of desire to object, the beauty always remains in the Utopia called desire.},

  abstract = {This new collection of key authors on nationalism presents the latest thinking on this fundamental aspect of Politics, International Relations and Sociology.  John Breuilly, Walker Connor, Steven Grosby, Eric Hobsbawm, Anthony D Smith and Pierre van den Berghe comprehensively explain and~address the~key contemporary question in nationalism studies of~ 'when is the nation?' , or what point in a nation's history is it born, with authority and freshness. Our world is still deeply imbedded in the language and practice of nations and nationalism and they remain central parts~in understanding human society.~This comparison and contrast of~the main approaches reveals~their strengths and weaknesses. This new text:~ * introduces the main schools of thought with clarity and concision * tackles the most pertinent questions in nationalism * delivers both theoretical and empirical perspectives * uses an innovative new interactive debate format with questions and answers  * presents key case studies bringing theory to life The inclusion of case studies gives the reader fresh insight into specific nations and national groups, including~The United States,~Greece, England and Fiji.~The accessible debate format puts main theories and thinkers to the test, enabling the reader~to~interact with the issues directly.~ This unique volume is an invaluable resource for students and scholars of nationalism, ethnicity and global conflict.},

  abstract = {The Senster The Senster, commissioned by the electronics giant, Philips, for their permanent showplace, the Evoluon, in Eindhoven, was a much bigger and more ambitious piece of work than SAM. In addition to responding to people's voices, the Senster also responded to their movements, which it detected by means of radar, and was (as far as I know) the first robotic sculpture to be controlled by a computer. It was unveiled in 1970 and remained on permanent show until 1974 when it was dismantled. Its size - it was over 15 feet (4 m) long and could reach as high into the air - made the use of aluminium castings inappropriate, so it was welded out of steel tubing, with the castings employed only in the more intricate microphone positioning mechanism. Its behaviour, controlled by a computer, was much more subtle than SAM's but still fairly simple. The microphones would locate the direction of any predominant sound and home in on it, rather like SAM but much more efficiently, and the rest of the structure would follow them in stages if the sound persisted. Sudden movements or loud noises would make it shy away. The complicated acoustics of the hall and the completely unpredictable behaviour of the public made the Senster's movements seem a lot more sophisticated than they actually were. It soon became obvious that it was that behaviour and not anything in its appearance which was responsble for the impact which the Senster undoubtedly had on the audience. For more on the Senster, have a look at some of the links on the left and the links in the section Articles about Edward Ihnatowicz and his work. What happened to the Senster ?},

  abstract = {This paper aims to highlight the interplay of technology and cybernetics within conceptual art. Just as Lucy Lippard has illustrated the influence of information theory within 1960s conceptual art, this paper traces the technological discourses within conceptual art through to contemporary digital art—specifically, establishing a correlation between Katherine Hayles's mapping of first-, second- and third-wave cybernetic narratives and, respectively, 1960s–1970s conceptual art, 1970s–1990s video art and new media art. Technology is shown to have a major influence on conceptual art, but one often based on historical, social and cybernetic narratives. This paper echoes Krzystof Ziarek's call for a Heideggerian poiesis and Adorno/Blanchotnian “nonpower” within conceptual art and advocates Ziarek's notion of “powerfree” artistic practices within new media and transgenic art.},

This text assumes students have been exposed to intermediate algebra, and it focuses on the applications of statistical knowledge rather than the theory behind it. The foundation of this textbook is Collaborative Statistics, by Barbara Illowsky and Susan Dean, which has been widely adopted. Introductory Statistics includes innovations in art, terminology, and practical applications, all with a goal of increasing relevance and accessibility for students. We strove to make the discipline meaningful and memorable, so that students can draw a working knowledge from it that will enrich their future studies and help them make sense of the world around them. The text also includes Collaborative Exercises, integration with TI-83,83+,84+ Calculators, technology integration problems, and statistics labs},

  abstract = {Almost thirty years ago, W. J. T. Mitchell’s~Iconology~helped launch the interdisciplinary study of visual media, now a central feature of the humanities. Along with his subsequent~Picture Theory~and~What Do Pictures Want?, Mitchell’s now-classic work introduced such ideas as the pictorial turn, the image/picture distinction, the metapicture, and the biopicture. These key concepts imply an approach to images as true objects of investigation—an “image science.” Continuing with this influential line of thought,~Image Science~gathers Mitchell’s most recent essays on media aesthetics, visual culture, and artistic symbolism. The chapters delve into such topics as the physics and biology of images, digital photography and realism, architecture and new media, and the occupation of space in contemporary popular uprisings. The book looks both backward at the emergence of iconology as a field and forward toward what might be possible if image science can indeed approach pictures the same way that empirical sciences approach natural phenomena. Essential for those involved with any aspect of visual media,~Image Science~is a brilliant call for a method of studying images that overcomes the “two-culture split” between the natural and human sciences.},

Innis's The Bias of Communication has played a major part in reshaping our understanding of history, communication, and media theory.

Innis considers political and economic forces in the context of social change and the role of communication in the creation of both ancient and modern empires.In an essay for this new edition, Innis biographer Alexander John Watson examines the reasons why Innis, at the height of his success as an economic historian, embarked on new research areas of communications and empire, as well as the ways in which Marshall McLuhan's interpretations of Innis changed and de-politicized Innis's work.As important today as it was when first published, The Bias of Communication is essential reading for historians and scholars of communication and media studies.},

  abstract = {Over the past decade, we have witnessed a proliferation of self-organized activist initiatives taking aim at the institutions of the art system. From the Guggenheim to the Brooklyn Museum, institutions have been targeted for their complicity in perpetuating, neglecting, or concealing various forms of injustice. These developments have involved a simultaneous decentering of authority and an intensification of accountability. Looking beyond the art-historical legacies of institutional critique, which is often invoked to analyze these developments, “From Institutional Critique to Institutional Liberation?“ offers a decolonial perspective on the political crises of contemporary art, one grounded in the work of movement-building. It argues that without acknowledging and confronting the “colonial matrix of power” that binds white supremacy, heteropatriarchy, and settler violence, activist engagements with art institutions are liable to remain confined to single-issue campaigns lacking in solidarity with one another and easily neutralized by their targets. Decolonize This Place, an ongoing artistico-political formation best known for its three-month conversion of Artists Space into a “movement undercommons” in 2016, is presented as one example of what decolonial organizing could look like when the art system and contemporary liberation struggles meet.},

In identifying these common misconceptions, the author offers insight on successful online works, provides inspiration to Internet artists, and explains that geographical location does not measure success when making art for the Internet. The article also mentions that the World Wide Web is only one of the many parts that make up the Internet. Other online protocols include e-mail, peer-to-peer instant messaging, video-conferencing software, MP3 audio files, and text-only environments like MUDs and MOOs. The author concludes his list of myths with the idea that surfing the Internet is not a solitary experience. Online communities and listservers, along with interactive Internet artworks that trace viewers and integrate their actions into respective interfaces, prove that the Internet is a social mechanism.},

  abstract = {This is a renaissance moment for video games -- in the variety of genres they represent, and the range of emotional territory they cover. But how do games create emotion? In  How Games Move Us, Katherine Isbister takes the reader on a timely and novel exploration of the design techniques that evoke strong emotions for players. She counters arguments that games are creating a generation of isolated, emotionally numb, antisocial loners. Games, Isbister shows us, can actually play a powerful role in creating empathy and other strong, positive emotional experiences; they reveal these qualities over time, through the act of playing. She offers a nuanced, systematic examination of exactly how games can influence emotion and social connection, with examples -- drawn from popular, indie, and art games -- that unpack the gamer's experience.  Isbister describes choice and flow, two qualities that distinguish games from other media, and explains how game developers build upon these qualities using avatars, non-player characters, and character customization, in both solo and social play. She shows how designers use physical movement to enhance players' emotional experience, and examines long-distance networked play. She illustrates the use of these design methods with examples that range from Sony's Little Big Planet to the much-praised indie game Journey to art games like Brenda Romero's Train. Isbister's analysis shows us a new way to think about games, helping us appreciate them as an innovative and powerful medium for doing what film, literature, and other creative media do: helping us to understand ourselves and what it means to be human.},

Il est incapable de discerner si la personne qu'il aime est un e＾tre humain ou bien un automate et il n'est pas su＾r de sa propre identite´ comme e＾tre humain. Cette incapacite´, quant a` elle, trouve son origine dans son expe´rience traumatisante pendant laquelle fut remise en question son identite´ en tant qu'e＾tre humain. Or, cette confusion d'identite´ n'est pas, selon nous, un proble`me isole´ et individuel dun esprit de´re´gl´e, mais pluto＾t un proble`me historiquement concret auquel tous les hommes modernes sont plus ou moins expose´s. Pour e´tayer notre the`se, nous replac¿ons l'histoire de Nathanae¨l dans un contexte historique plus vaste qu'est l'histoire de la conception me´canique ou me´caniste de l'homme. Ensuite est examine´e, en vue de comparaison, la question fondamentale que leur monisme mate´rialiste a fait poser aux mate´rialistes franc¿ais du XVIIIe sie`cle comme La Mettrie et Diderot. Cette question des philosophes et celle qui est pre´sente´e sous une forme litte´raire par Hoffmann, bien qu'elles partagent les me＾mes fondements historiques et the´oriques, ne sont pas identiques. Nous constatons enfin que la question pose´e par Hoffmann est celle qui aurait du＾, du point de vue logique, se poser, mais que les philosophes de l'e´poque, qu'ils soient partisans de cette conception me´caniste ou du mate´rialisme, n'en ont pratiquement pas pris une conscience claire et distincte. Voila` pourquoi nous de´finissons ce conte comme une re´action litte´raire d'Hoffmann contre la conception me´caniste de l'homme.},

  abstract = {The past several years have seen a growing emphasis on Information Retrieval (IR). Actually, information retrieval is not new. We have had books, libraries and reference librarians for many years. What is new is the application of mechanized methods for accomplishing these age-old tasks and the application of computers to assist in solving what is developing into a national problem. There are some who believe that we have already reached the problem stage, or even gone beyond. Information retrieval is the art of extracting from storage, information desired at a particular point in time, in response to specific requests. The information has been stored originally with consideration for its eventual accessibility. (Information retrieval is not as complicated as many other computer applications although the problems associated with it have been rather difficult to solve.) While the term retrieval connotes the act of “regaining” or “recovering” the information, the retrieval concept extends further. It involves the aspects of information collection, selection, indexing, storage, retrieval, and dissemination.},

The territories forming this colossus ranged from tiny islands to vast segments of the world's major continental land masses, and included Australia, South Africa, India, and Canada. This vast empire left its mark on the world in a multitude of ways, many of them permanent. In this Very Short Introduction, Ashley Jackson introduces and defines the British Empire, shedding light on a series of key questions, reviewing how it evolved into such a force, and looking at the legacy it left behind.About the Series:Oxford's Very Short Introductions series offers concise and original introductions to a wide range of subjects--from Islam to Sociology, Politics to Classics, Literary Theory to History, and Archaeology to the Bible. Not simply a textbook of definitions, each volume in this series provides trenchant and provocative--yet always balanced and complete--discussions of the central issues in a given discipline or field. Every Very Short Introduction gives a readable evolution of the subject in question, demonstrating how the subject has developed and how it has influenced society. Eventually, the series will encompass every major academic discipline, offering all students an accessible and abundant reference library. Whatever the area of study that one deems important or appealing, whatever the topic that fascinates the general reader, the Very Short Introductions series has a handy and affordable guide that will likely prove indispensable.},

  abstract = {Functional MRI was used to investigate the neural correlates of aesthetic judgments of beauty of geometrical shapes. Participants performed evaluative aesthetic judgments (beautiful or not?) and descriptive symmetry judgments (symmetric or not?) on the same stimulus material. Symmetry was employed because aesthetic judgments are known to be often guided by criteria of symmetry. Novel, abstract graphic patterns were presented to minimize influences of attitudes or memory-related processes and to test effects of stimulus symmetry and complexity. Behavioral results confirmed the influence of stimulus symmetry and complexity on aesthetic judgments. Direct contrasts showed specific activations for aesthetic judgments in the frontomedian cortex (BA 9/10), bilateral prefrontal BA 45/47, and posterior cingulate, left temporal pole, and the temporoparietal junction. In contrast, symmetry judgments elicited specific activations in parietal and premotor areas subserving spatial processing. Interestingly, beautiful judgments enhanced BOLD signals not only in the frontomedian cortex, but also in the left intraparietal sulcus of the symmetry network. Moreover, stimulus complexity caused differential effects for each of the two judgment types. Findings indicate aesthetic judgments of beauty to rely on a network partially overlapping with that underlying evaluative judgments on social and moral cues and substantiate the significance of symmetry and complexity for our judgment of beauty.},

The status of this psychology of aesthetics, the science of aesthetic processing, is briefly reviewed here. Building on this heritage and drawing on a host of related scientific disciplines, a framework for a strongly interdisciplinary psychology of aesthetics is proposed. It is argued that the topic can be fruitfully approached from at least seven different perspectives, each with multiple levels of analysis: diachronia, ipsichronia, mind, body, content, person and situation. Eventually, this work may coalesce into a unified theory of aesthetic processing.},

Dick, Ursula LeGuin, William Gibson, Brian Aldiss, Kim Stanley Robinson and more. Jameson's essential essays, including "The Desire Called Utopia," conclude with an examination of the opposing positions on utopia and an assessment of its political value today.Archaeologies of the Future is the third volume, after Postmodernism and A Singular Modernity, of Jameson's project on the Poetics of Social Forms.},

Historicizing a form that has flourished in a post-modern and anti-historical culture, he explores the allegorical and ideological dimensions of such films as The Shining, Dog Day Afternoon and the works of Alfred Hitchcock, among many others. Fifteen years on from its original publication, this remains a piercing and original analysis of film from a writer and thinker whose influence continues to be felt long after that of the fashionable post-modernists he has always critiqued.},

Seeing human behavior as that of a natural organism governed by the will to life, Schopenhauer developed radical insights concerning the unconscious and sexuality which influenced both psychologists and philosophers},

The sites selected for this study are the 11 cities and districts (5667.6 km2) that cut across the vast granary in the southeastern region of Korea, near the Yeongsan River. The emotional map was produced by extracting features of historical and cultural heritage distributed throughout this region and by using a geographic information systems program and its functions for spatial analysis. A database was constructed through interviews with locals and Global Positioning System to index 4318 pieces of cultural heritage to achieve the visualization of emotions. Among the 558 historical relics considered for representing the regional culture, 100 with the largest emotional impact were selected. It was determined that loyalty , justice , courtesy , resentment , and anger should be the major emotional elements. Methodologically, a set of regional, periodic, historical, and emotional classification codes were first systematized. After subjecting this data to inverse distance weight interpolation and vertical exaggeration coefficients, the three-dimensional emotional map could be visualized.},

  year = 2016,

  publisher = {Verso Books},
  abstract = {Who were the Frankfurt School—Benjamin, Adorno, Marcuse, Horkheimer—and why do they matter today?In 1923, a group of young radical German thinkers and intellectuals came together to at Victoria Alle 7, Frankfurt, determined to explain the workings of the modern world. Among the most prominent members of what became the Frankfurt School were the philosophers Walter Benjamin, Theodor Adorno, Max Horkheimer, and Herbert Marcuse. Not only would they change the way we think, but also the subjects we deem worthy of intellectual investigation. Their lives, like their ideas, profoundly, sometimes tragically, reflected and shaped the shattering events of the twentieth century.Grand Hotel Abyss combines biography, philosophy, and storytelling to reveal how the Frankfurt thinkers gathered in hopes of understanding the politics of culture during the rise of fascism. Some of them, forced to escape the horrors of Nazi Germany, later found exile in the United States. Benjamin, with his last great work—the incomplete Arcades Project—in his suitcase, was arrested in Spain and committed suicide when threatened with deportation to Nazi-occupied France. On the other side of the Atlantic, Adorno failed in his bid to become a Hollywood screenwriter, denounced jazz, and even met Charlie Chaplin in Malibu.After the war, there was a resurgence of interest in the School. From the relative comfort of sun-drenched California, Herbert Marcuse wrote the classic One Dimensional Man, which influenced the 1960s counterculture and thinkers such as Angela Davis; while in a tragic coda, Adorno died from a heart attack following confrontations with student radicals in Berlin.By taking popular culture seriously as an object of study—whether it was film, music, ideas, or consumerism—the Frankfurt School elaborated upon the nature and crisis of our mass-produced, mechanised society. Grand Hotel Abyss shows how much these ideas still tell us about our age of social media and runaway consumption.},

  abstract = {"Offering historical and theoretical positions from a variety of art historians, artists, curators, and writers, this groundbreaking collection is the first substantive sourcebook on abstraction in moving-image media. With a particular focus on art since 2000, Abstract Video addresses a longer history of experimentation in video, net art, installation, new media, expanded cinema, visual music, and experimental film. Editor Gabrielle Jennings--a video artist herself--reveals as never before how works of abstract video are not merely, as the renowned curator Kirk Varnedoe once put it, 'pictures of nothing,' but rather amorphous, ungovernable spaces that encourage contemplation and innovation. Featuring renowned artists such as Jeremy Blake, Mona Hatoum, Pierre Huyghe, Ryoji Ikeda, Takeshi Murata, Diana Thater and Jennifer West, alongside emerging artists, this volume offers fresh and vigorous perspectives on a burgeoning and ever-changing arena of contemporary art"--Provided by publisher},

(…) 이런 젠장”으로 시작하는 첫 챕터에서 독자들은 감을 잡겠지만 이 책은 진중한 주제의식에도 불구하고 ‘각 잡고’ 진지한 소설이 아니다. 남도의 구수한 입말로 풀어낸 일화들은 저마다 서글프지만 피식피식 웃기고, “울분이 솟다 말고 ‘긍게 사람이제’ 한마디로 가슴이 따뜻”(추천사, 김미월)해진다. ~ 시트콤 같은 일화들아버지를 이해하기 위하여 ~ 아버지는 지리산과 백운산을 카빈 소총을 들고 누빈 빨치산이었다. 그는 일제강점기가 끝난 직후 평등한 세상을 꿈꾸며 싸웠으나 처절하게 패배했다. 동지들은 하나둘 죽었고, 아버지는 위장 자수로 조직을 재건하려 하지만 그마저 실패했다. 그럼에도 아버지는 자본주의 한국에서 평생을 사회주의자로 살았다. 평등한 세상이 올 거라는 믿음을 포기하지 않았고, 생판 초면인 이들의 어려움도 무시하지 않았다. ‘나’는 그런 아버지를 이해하지 못하는 것은 물론, 조금 우스꽝스럽게 생각한다. 누구나 배불리 먹고 차별없이 교육받는 세상이 이미 이뤄진 마당에 혁명을 목전에 둔 듯 행동하는 아버지의 모습은 누가 봐도 블랙코미디에 가깝기 때문이다. 그렇게 평행선을 달려온 ‘나’와 아버지. 그런 아버지가 죽었다. 노동절 새벽, 전봇대에 머리를 박고.이 이야기는 크게 네 줄기로 이뤄진다. 첫번째는 아버지와 평생을 반목해온, 그의 동생인 작은아버지와의 이야기다. ‘빨갱이’ 형 때문에 집안이 망했다고 생각하는 작은아버지는, 형의 죽음을 알리는 전화를 대꾸도 없이 끊을 만큼 냉담하다. 평생 술꾼으로 산 작은아버지는 이따금 집에 찾아와 “니는 그리 잘나서 집안 말아묵었냐?”(38면)라며 행패를 부리기도 했다. 그때마다 아버지는 맞서지 않고 묵묵부답 대답하지 않았다. ‘나’는 차라리 작은아버지가 장례식장에 나타나지 않기를 바란다. 그의 등장 여부는 장례식장에 모인 모두의 관심사인 한편, 독자들도 책을 읽는 내내 흥미진진 궁금하게 지켜보게 된다. 죽은 아버지와 산 작은아버지는 화해할 수 있을까.두번째는 구례에서 아버지가 사귀어온 친구들의 이야기다. 이들의 면면은 실로 다양하고 입체적이라 살펴보는 것만으로 한편의 시트콤을 보는 듯하다. 아버지의 소학교 동창이자 시계방을 운영하는 박선생. 그는 평생을 군인과 교련선생으로 살아왔기 때문에 대척점에 있지만 아버지의 둘도 없는 친구다. 정치적 지향 차이로 발생하는 두 노인의 투닥거림은 어딘지 귀엽고, 그 끝에 “그래도 사램은 갸가 젤 낫아야”(47면)라는 말은 지금의 정치권이 배웠으면 싶은 생각도 든다. 그리고 이 장례식에 어울리지 않게 등장한 샛노란 머리의 소녀. 어찌된 영문인지 그는 아버지의 “담배 친구”(139면)란다. 열일곱살 소녀와 허물없이 친해지는 것은 아버지이기에 가능한 일이지만, 그 와중에도 어머니가 베트남인인 소녀에게 ‘미 제국주의’ 운운하는 것을 잊지 않는 아버지의 캐릭터는 여전히 웃음을 자아낸다. 그밖에 ‘학수’를 비롯해 아버지의 아들을 자처하는 많은 사람들, 총부리를 맞서고 싸웠지만 이윽고 친구가 된 웃지 못할 사연들이 속속 등장한다. ~ 내가 알던 아버지는 진짜일까?그가 남기고 간 수많은 에피소드~ 세번째는 ‘나’와 아버지의 이야기다. 『아버지의 해방일지』의 가장 큰 줄기는 ‘빨치산의 딸’로 힘들게 살아온 딸이 아버지를 이해하는 과정이다. 사회주의자이고 혁명전사였기에 생활력은 없었고, 그런 주제에 “보증을 서”(57면)주는 일도 마다하지 않았기에 늘 가난했던 집안 형편은 전부 아버지 탓이었다. 시도 때도 없이 아버지가 늘어놓는 장광설은 지금 현실과는 맞지 않았고, 그런 만큼 ‘나’는 아버지가 있는 고향을 떠나고 싶어했다. 그런데 아버지의 죽음 이후 ‘나’는 내가 알던 아버지의 얼굴이 아주 일부였음을 깨닫는다. 아버지의 합리적이고 현실적인 면들이 밝혀지고, 사람들을 감화시킨 담대한 모습들도 드러난다. 무엇보다 내가 잊고 있었던, ‘나’를 사랑했던 순간순간들이 떠오른다. 마침내 ‘나’는 아버지의 유골을 손에 들고, 아버지를 가장 아버지다운 방식으로 보낼 한가지 결심을 한다.마지막 네번째는 어머니와 아버지 사이의 일화들이다. 이들은 서사의 무게를 한층 발랄하게 만들며 독자들의 웃음을 자아낸다. 평생의 동지이자 그 역시 사회주의자였던 어머니는 아버지보다는 현실적이다. 그래서 아버지는 이런저런 일로 늘 구박을 받는다. 옷을 털지 않아서 술 담배를 끊지 못해서 같은 비교적 소소한 일도 있고, 빚보증을 서서 농사를 내팽겨져서 같은 큰일도 있다. 어찌 보면 앙숙 같은 이들은 ‘유물론’과 ‘민족’ 앞에서 경건하게 하나가 되기도 하는데, 이러한 우스꽝스러운 ‘티키타카’는 아버지의 삶을 이해하는 유쾌한 촉매제가 되어준다. ~ “빨치산의 딸, 한국문학의 딸로”정지아라는 센세이션~ 32년 전 정지아의 등장은 한국문학에서 하나의 센세이션이었다. 판매금지와 공안 당국의 기소 같은 일련의 사건 때문이 아니라, 그가 보여준 핍진한 서술과 역사를 대하는 진지한 태도 때문이었다. 이제 정지아는 그 태도에 더해 사실과 허구를 섞어가며 자유자재로 이야기를 다루는 관록과, 마지막 페이지까지 독자의 손을 꼭 붙들어놓는 대가의 면모까지 갖추었다. 32년 만에 내놓는 이 소설로 정지아가 다시 한번 그 존재감을 증명하게 되리라 기대하는 이유도 바로 여기에 있다. “정지아는 빨치산의 딸일 뿐 아니라 우리 문학의 귀하디귀한 딸”(소설가 김미월)이 되었다는 말에, 한국문학을 사랑하는 모두가 귀를 기울여야만 한다. ~ ~ 추천사 ~ 배척과 갈등의 말, 금기어로 여겨져온 ‘빨갱이’라는 단어는 어쩌면 유령 같은 것이었는지도 모르겠다. 나는 그 시절을 보낸 이들의 세계를 짐작이나 할 수 있을까. 아버지의 장례식에서 만나는 얽히고설킨 사연들에 빠져들다보면 그들이 빨갛지도 파랗지도 않은, 그저 저마다의 삶을 꾸려온 ‘사람’이었음을 알게 된다. 무채색의 크고 작은 파문을 서로에게 일으키며 한 시대를 함께 건너온 이들에게서, 이념과 역사의 소용돌이 속에서도 결국엔 나약하고 또 강인한 우리 인생이 보인다. 정지아의 소설은 그래서 매력적이다.박혜진 아나운서~ 소설을 읽고 운 것이 대체 얼마 만의 일인가. 빨려들듯 몰입하여 책 한권을 앉은자리에서 다 읽은 것은 또 얼마 만인가. 책장을 덮고 나서도 먹먹한 가슴을 어쩌지 못해 나는 한참을 가만히 앉아 있었다. 아버지의 장례식이라는 사건 하나로 잊히거나 지워진 우리 현대사의 상흔들을 어제 일처럼 생생하게 펼쳐놓고 관련 인물들을 죄다 불러내 각각의 사연을 풀어놓는, 그것들이 종으로 횡으로 오지랖 넓게 뻗어나가다 결국은 헤쳐 모여 이미 소멸한 아버지를 불멸의 존재로 소생시키는, 이런 소설은 어떻게 쓰는 것일까. 서글프지 않은 일화가 없는데 실실 웃음이 나올 만큼 재미있고, 억울하지 않은 삶이 없는데 울분이 솟다 말고 ‘긍게 사램이제’ 한마디로 가슴이 따뜻해지는 이런 소설은. 정지아의 전작을 따라 읽어왔으니 이만하면 성실한 독자라 자부할 만한데도 나는 모른다. 그가 등단작부터 천착해온 주제를 어느 정도 예상하고 책을 펼쳤는데도 어찌하여 처음 보는 내용인 듯 순식간에 빠져들게 되는지, 어찌하여 새삼스레 경탄하고 오히려 더 깊이 감화하게 되는지를. 알 도리가 없으니 이렇게 말할 수밖에 없다. 긍게 정지아제.김미월 소설가~ ~ 책 속으로 ~ 아버지가 죽었다. 전봇대에 머리를 박고. 평생을 정색하고 살아온 아버지가 전봇대에 머리를 박고 진지 일색의 삶을 마감한 것이다.만우절은 아니었다. 만우절이라 한들 그런 장난이나 유머가 오가는 집안도 아니었다. 유머라니. 유머는 우리 집안에서 일종의 금기였다. 그렇다고 유머가 없었던 것은 아니다. 누가 봐도 유머일 수밖에 없고 유머여야 하는 순간에도 내 부모는 혁명을 목전에 둔 혁명가처럼 진지했고, 그게 사람들의 웃음을 자아냈다. (7면)~ 개 이름 같은 아리는 내 이름이다. 아버지가 활동했던 백아산의 아, 어머니가 활동했던 지리산의 리,를 딴 이름 덕분에 나는 숱한 홍역을 치렀다(사실 아버지가 주로 활동한 곳은 백아산보다는 백운산이었다. 그런데도 백아산의 아를 따온 것은 백운산의 백이나 운이 여자아이 이름으로는 적합하지 않다는, 그러니까 제 아무리 남녀평등을 주장했다 한들 반봉건시대에 태어나 가부장제의 그늘을 아주 벗어나지는 못한 반봉건적 사유의 발로였던 것이다). 학교에서나 관공서에서나 고아리, 내 이름을 말하면 아유, 이름이 참 예쁘네, 얼굴도 참…… 하면서 나를 쳐다보았고 이내 말줄임표가 뒤따랐다. (29면)~ 유물론자다운 대답이 나는 만족스러웠다.“그럼 제사는?”“지사는 무신 지사. 헹제라도 많아서 핑계 김에 얼굴이나 볼라먼 모릴까 니 혼찬디 지사는 무신 지사.”아버지는 뼛속까지 유물론자였다. 부모가 여든 넘도록 장지 마련은 고사하고 영정사진 찍어둘 생각조차 못한 불효자식이었으나 아버지의 유지가 그러하였으니 따르면 될 터였다. 역시 유물론은 산뜻해서 좋다. (94면)~ “오죽흐먼 나헌티 전화를 했겄어, 이 밤중에!”또 그놈의 오죽하면 타령이었다. 사람이 오죽하면 그러겠느냐,는 아버지의 십팔번이었다. 나는 아버지와 달리 오죽해서 아버지를 찾는 마음을 믿지 않았다. 사람은 힘들 때 가장 믿거나 가장 만만한 사람을 찾는다. 어느 쪽이든 결과는 마찬가지다. 힘들 때 도움받은 그 마음을 평생 간직하는 사람은 열에 하나도 되지 않는다. 대개는 도움을 준 사람보다 도움을 받은 사람이 그 은혜를 먼저 잊어버린다. (102면)~ “노동이…… 노동이…… 힘들어.”그때까지 위태위태 잘 참고 있던 나는 노동이 힘들다는 빨치산의 고백에 그만 풉, 웃음을 뿜고 말았다. 스스로도 염치가 없었는지 그가 비식 웃으며 덧붙였다.“사흘 노가다 뛰고 석달 입원했네. 나는 암만해도 노동과 친해지질 않아.”“저놈의 부르주아 근성은 머리가 희캐져도 뿌리가 안 뽑히그마이. 그런 놈이 멀라고 뽈갱이는 돼가꼬……” (150면)~ 월남전에서 다리를 잃었다고 했으니 아마도 육십년대 후반이나 칠십년대 초반, 원래의 다리보다 더 오래 다리 노릇을 해온 때문인지 노인은 지팡이를 능숙하게 움직여 비틀거리지도 않고 내 쪽으로 다가왔다.“아따 조문은 무신…… 나랑 쐬주나 마시장게.”다리 불편한 노인네를 확 낚아챌 수도 없는 노릇, 황사장이 어쩌지도 못하고 졸졸 뒤를 따르며 다그쳤다.“왜? 나는 베트콩 때려잡던 사램잉게 뽈갱이 조문하먼 안 된다는 것이여! 나가 고상욱이 때려잡았간디?” (193면)~ “넘의 딸이 담배 피우먼 못된 년이고, 내 딸이 담배 피우먼 호기심이여? 그거이 바로 소시민성의 본질이네! 소시민성 한나 극복 못헌 사램이 무신 헥명을 하겄다는 것이여!”그때 어머니 나이 환갑을 넘었다. 환갑 넘은 빨갱이들이 자본주의 남한에서 무슨 혁명을 하겠다고 극복 운운하는 것인지, 이것이야말로 진정한 블랙 코미디다, 그런 생각을 하며 나는 자리를 떴다. 담배 생각이 간절했다. 오직 담배를 태우기 위해 나는 동네 사람이 절대 다니지 않을 산중턱까지 올랐다. 담배 세대를 연달아 태우는 동안 바라본 우리 집은 성냥갑 같았다. (243\textasciitilde 43면)~ ~ 차례 ~ 아버지의 해방일지작가의 말~ ~ 작가의 말 ~ (…)고향에 돌아오니 서울서 보이지 않던 아름다움 천지다. 섬진강변의 벚꽃길, 반야봉의 낙조, 노고단의 운해만 아름다운 게 아니다. 벚꽃은 정 읎어 싫고 산수유는 속 읎어 싫다는 동네 할매, 필요 없다고 해도 밥을 묵어야 힘이 난다며 기어이 가져다주는 식당 주인, 심지어는 먹도 못할 억센 나물을 삶으면 부드럽다고 뻥쳐서 파는 장터 할매, 주방에서 가장 먼 안쪽 테이블에 앉았더니 사람도 없는데 가차이 앉으라고 호통치는 식당 아줌마(알고 보니 그이는 관절염이 심했다)까지, 이곳엔 사람 냄새 넘치는 사람이 그득하다. 오죽하면 할매가 뻥을 치겠는가. 다 먹고살자고 하는 짓이다. 급하면 뻥도 치고 호통도 치는 것이 사람 아닌가.사램이 오죽하면 글겄냐. 아버지 십팔번이었다. 그 말 받아들이고 보니 세상이 이리 아름답다. 진작 아버지 말 들을 걸 그랬다.아버지. 아버지 딸, 참 오래도 잘못 살았습니다. 그래도 뭐, 환갑 전에 알기는 했으니 쭉 모르는 것보다는 낫겠지요? 딸을 대장부의 몸으로 낳아주신 것도, 하의 상의 인물로 낳아주신 것도 다 이해할 터이니 그간의 오만을, 무례를, 어리석음을 너그러이 용서하시길…… 감사합니다, 아버지. 애기도 하는 이 쉬운 말을 환갑 목전에 두고 아버지 가고 난 이제야 합니다. 어쩌겠어요? 그게 아버지 딸인걸. 이 못난 딸이 이 책을 아버지께 바칩니다.},

This research represents an attempt to demonstrate the appropriateness of digital technology as a tool for the active creation of simulated surface effects in urban environments.

  abstract = {This special issue of \emph{South Asian Popular Culture} was inspired by the existing and emerging work on interdisciplinarity and design. Conversations among Amit S. Rai, Priya Jha, and Rajinder Dudrah over the past several years fleshed out some of the ways in which design studies would serve as a useful intervention in the study of colonial histories and postcolonial cultures of South Asia. Beginning with a definition of design as a cognitive assemblage which translates information and/or ideas into concrete forms, where we recognize that assemblage is neither irreducible nor immanent, this project connects with work done by scholars in fields as diverse as literary studies, feminist studies, postcolonial studies, new media, art history, anthropology, and film studies. How can the study of design help us to challenge assumptions about the distribution of power in a globalized, transnationalized era, particularly around notions of authenticity, exotic-ness, and colonial passivity in relation to post-colonial identity formations across nations? Designs may be regarded as diagrams of mental maps of individual and collective cultures, which can have profound implications for the re-envisioning of postcolonial histories. The infusion of design studies with strands of postcolonial theories such as nationalism; transnationalism; transculturalism; diaspora; displacement, among others, can reveal the much-needed work in linking these modes to the distribution of power through emotional evocations and 'experience'. The methodologies developed through this integrative practice provides invaluable insight into analyzing the structures of power and identities shaped by the violent and traumatic histories of colonialisms and imperialisms.}

In his own time, Benjamin's contemporaries Theodor Adorno and Andre Breton were suspicious of the role that objective images played in commodity capitalism. Adorno's Frankfurt School Marxism and Breton's Marxist surrealism illustrate the way that subjective images can be mobilized to think through the totality of capitalism rather than its products. This essay argues against the confusion of the dialectical image and its method with commodities.},

  year = 1999,
  abstract = {Genesis is a transgenic artwork that explores the intricate relationship between biology, belief systems, information technology, dialogical interaction, ethics, and the Internet. The key element of the work is an "artist's gene", a synthetic gene that was created by Kac by translating a sentence from the biblical book of Genesis into Morse Code, and converting the Morse Code into DNA base pairs according to a conversion principle specially developed by the artist for this work. The sentence reads: "Let man have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moves upon the earth." It was chosen for what it implies about the dubious notion--divinely sanctioned--of humanity's supremacy over nature. Morse code was chosen because, as the first example of the use of radiotelegraphy, it represents the dawn of the information age--the genesis of global communication. The Genesis gene was incorporated into bacteria, which were shown in the gallery. Participants on the Web could turn on an ultraviolet light in the gallery, causing real, biological mutations in the bacteria. This changed the biblical sentence in the bacteria. After the show, the DNA of the bacteria was translated back into Morse code, and then back into English. The mutation that took place in the DNA had changed the original sentence from the Bible. The mutated sentence was posted on the Genesis web site. In the context of the work, the ability to change the sentence is a symbolic gesture: it means that we do not accept its meaning in the form we inherited it, and that new meanings emerge as we seek to change it.},

Adam Kahane has faced this challenge many times, working on big issues like democracy and jobs and climate change and on everyday issues in organizations and families. He has learned that our conventional understanding of collaboration-that it requires a harmonious team that agrees on where it's going, how it's going to get there, and who needs to do what-is wrong. Instead, we need a new approach to collaboration that embraces discord, experimentation, and genuine cocreation-which is exactly what Kahane provides in this groundbreaking and timely book},

But it’s worse when people inside these companies can’t pinpoint the problem because they’re too focused on business processes. This practical book shows your company how to use alignment diagrams to turn valuable customer observations into actionable insight. With this unique tool, you can visually map your existing customer experience and envision future solutions.Product and brand managers, marketing specialists, and business owners will learn how experience diagramming can help determine where business goals and customer perspectives intersect. Once you’re armed with this data, you can provide users with real value.Mapping Experiences is divided into three parts:Understand the underlying principles of diagramming, and discover how these diagrams can inform strategyLearn how to create diagrams with the four iterative modes in the mapping process: setting up a mapping initiative, investigating the evidence, visualizing the process, and using diagrams in workshops and experimentsSee key diagrams in action, including service blueprints, customer journey maps, experience maps, mental models, and spatial maps and ecosystem models},

  abstract = {This paper examines some of the implications associated with the growing complexity of the contemporary world, consequent upon the expanding economic and organizational involvement of ICT-based systems and artefacts. Drawing on Luhmann, traditional forms of technological control are analyzed in terms of functional simplification and closure. Functional simplification involves the demarcation of an operational domain within which the complexity of the world is reconstructed as a simplified set of causal or instrumental relations. Functional closure implies the construction of a protective cocoon that is placed around the selected causal sequences to ensure their recurrent unfolding. While possible to analyze in similar terms, current developments, as manifested in the diffusion of large-scale information systems and mostly the internet spin a web of technological relations that challenge the strategies of functional simplification and closure and the organizational practices that have traditionally accommodated them.},

Almost two decades later, when Bell lifted its restrictions on creative work not related to telephone technologies, the atmosphere had changed so dramatically that despite a relaxation of regulation, cutting-edge projects were abandoned. This paper discusses the struggles encountered in interdisciplinary collaborations and the challenge to use new media computing technology to make experimental art at Bell Labs during this unique time period, now largely lost to the history of the media arts.},

  abstract = {Color has long been at home in the domains of classical art and aesthetics. However, with the introduction of computer art in Germany in the early 1960s, a new rational theory' of art, media and color emerged. Many believed this new science' of art would generate computer algorithms which would enable new media aesthetic principles to be formulated mathematically' -- thus ending the lofty mystifications that have, for too long, been associated with Romantic notions about artwork and art-making. Although, as German computer artist Herbert Franke noted, Traditional aesthetic modes of expression are of little avail to the artist who works with technical systems, particularly computers', I argue herein that the shifts in aesthetic theory brought about by the introduction of computer art are more complex than a clear-cut subsumption to mathematics, information theory or cybernetics. While the Programming the Beautiful' project that began in Europe in the 1960s -- the three-fold rationalization of the artist, the artwork and color -- has been largely realized, nonetheless, today we find ourselves seeped in the neo-Romanticization of new media art, the reglorification of the role of the artist, and new digital color -- ironically, the exact opposite of what the project for rational art initially sought.},

I argue that, following Baudrillard, we can see nation brands in a new light, namely, as simulacra which exist within a transnational media system for the creation, circulation and consumption of commodity-signs. In this capacity, nation brands shed their representational burden of standing in for the nation and, instead, operate as self-referential entities. I use the example of Brand Kosovo to provide illustrations for my theoretical points. However, while the case of Kosovo has its specificities, I propose that the theoretical claims presented here hold beyond its parameters.

Jaeho Kang’s book offers a lucid introduction to Benjamin’s theory of the media and its continuing relevance today.  The book provides a systematic and close reading of Benjamin’s critical and provocative writings on the intersection between media - from print to electronic - and modern experience, with reference to the information industry, the urban spectacle, and the aesthetic politics. Bringing Benjamin’s thought into a critical constellation with contemporary media theorists such as Marshall McLuhan and Jean Baudrillard, the book helps students understand the implications of Benjamin’s work for media studies today and how they can apply his distinctive ideas to contemporary media culture.   Kang’s book leads to a fresh appreciation of Benjamin’s work and new insight into critical theoretical approaches to media. The book will be of particular interest to students and researchers not only in media and communication studies but also in cultural studies, film studies and social theory, who are seeking a readable overview of Benjamin’s rich yet complex writings.},

This new, revised edition of the Prolegomena, which is the best introduction to the theoretical side of his philosophy, presents his thought clearly by paying careful attention to his original language. Also included are selections from the Critique of Pure Reason, which fill out and explicate some of Kant's central arguments (including famous sections of the Schematism and Analogies), and in which Kant himself explains his special terminology. The first reviews of the Critique, to which Kant responded in the Prolegomena, are included in this revised edition. The volume is completed by a historical and philosophical introduction, explanatory notes, a chronology and a guide to further reading."--Jacket.},

  abstract = {The study discusses Aristotle's special use of Greek language as a historical construct defined by the need to accommodate the communicative needs of an expanding world (morphoplastic synapses). It addresses the paradoxical synthesis of Platonic idealism and empirical cognition which is expressed in his philosophical language and detects a deep incommensurability in their structural form. It argues that such conflict of paradigms in the work of Aristotle neutralized the interpretive potential of Greek language which focused on commentaries over a long period of time. Aristotle's thinking became important in Thomas Aquinas' philosophical summa by establishing a creative synthesis through the potentialities of Latin. The semantic neutralization of Greek continued until the 20th century when Cornelius Castoriadis proposed a new Aristotelian synthesis by re-interpreting his principle of imagination within a modern understanding of creativity.},

  abstract = {Today's virtual reality (VR) applications such as gaming, multisensory entertainment, remote dining, and online shopping are mainly based on audio, visual, and touch interactions between humans and virtual worlds. Integrating the sense of taste into VR is difficult since humans are dependent on chemical-based taste delivery systems. This paper presents the `Thermal Taste Machine', a new digital taste actuation technology that can effectively produce and modify thermal taste sensations on the tongue. It modifies the temperature of the surface of the tongue within a short period of time (from 25°C to 40 °C while heating, and from 25°C to 10 °C while cooling). We tested this device on human subjects and described the experience of thermal taste using 20 known (taste and non-taste) sensations. Our results suggested that rapidly heating the tongue produces sweetness, fatty/oiliness, electric taste, warmness, and reduces the sensibility for metallic taste. Similarly, cooling the tongue produced mint taste, pleasantness, and coldness. By conducting another user study on the perceived sweetness of sucrose solutions after the thermal stimulation, we found that heating the tongue significantly enhances the intensity of sweetness for both thermal tasters and non-thermal tasters. Also, we found that faster temperature rises on the tongue produce more intense sweet sensations for thermal tasters. This technology will be useful in two ways: First, it can produce taste sensations without using chemicals for the individuals who are sensitive to thermal taste. Second, the temperature rise of the device can be used as a way to enhance the intensity of sweetness. We believe that this technology can be used to digitally produce and enhance taste sensations in future virtual reality applications. The key novelties of this paper are as follows: 1. Development of a thermal taste actuation technology for stimulating the human taste receptors, 2. Characterization of the thermal taste produced by the device using taste-related sensations and non-taste related sensations, 3. Research on enhancing the intensity for sucrose solutions using thermal stimulation, 4. Research on how different speeds of heating affect the intensity of sweetness produced by thermal stimulation.},

  abstract = {The traditional landscape genre was radically transformed in the 1960s when many artists stopped merely representing the land and made their mark directly in the environment. Drawn by vast, uncultivated spaces of desert and mountain as well as by post-industrial wastelands, artists such as Michael Heizer, Nancy Holt and Robert Smithson moved earth to create colossal primal symbols. Others punctuated the horizon with man-made signposts, such as Christo's Running Fence and Walter de Maria's The Lightning Field. For Richard Long, journeys became works of art while Dennis Oppenheim immersed his entire body in the contours of the land. In this broad survey of Land Art, Brian Wallis discusses the key artists, works and issues that define Land Art historically, as well as its later ramifications.This book fully documents the 1960s Land Art movement and surveys examples of Environmental Art to the present day. Earthworks, environments, performances and actions by artists ranging from Ana Mendieta in the 1970s and 80s to Peter Fend in the 1990s are illustrated with breathtaking photographs, sketches and project notes.},

  abstract = {After the initial formulation of the concept of reification in Georg Lukács's History and Class Consciousness (HCC, 1923), a series of confusing uses of it within critical theory have contributed to blurring its contours. In his pre-Marxist work, while analyzing the social rationalization process, Lukács located the modern form of mediation between subject and object and connected it with certain effects on the level of human consciousness and behavior. This very scheme is repeated and refined in HCC. In the Reification essay, Lukács uses the neo-Kantian concept of the "form of objectivity" to grasp the central constitutive form of all kinds of objects in bourgeois society. He interprets Marx's commodity form as the "archetype" of all capitalist objectivity, which consists in converting qualitative contents into quantitative categories. Thus, the formal/calculative rationality of exchange penetrates all kinds of objectification in modern society. In Lukács's view, only in its modern, universalized form does rational objectification bring about the phenomenon of reification, i.e. the de-historicization and political neutralization of the social relations that constitute the social system and the dominant forms of consciousness. This systemic, cultural, and political understanding of reification can prove to be fruitful in the context of contemporary discussions on democratic transformative praxis.}

A sharp criticof contemporary society, culture, and thought, Baudrillard is oftenseen as a major guru of French postmodern theory, although he can alsobe read as a thinker who combines social theory and philosophy inoriginal and provocative ways and a writer who has developed his ownstyle and forms of writing. He was an extremely prolific author who haspublished over thirty books and commented on some of the most salientcultural and sociological phenomena of the contemporary era, includingthe erasure of the distinctions of gender, race, and class thatstructured modern societies in a new postmodern consumer, media, andhigh tech society; the mutating roles of art and aesthetics;fundamental changes in politics, culture, and human beings; and theimpact of new media, information, and cybernetic technologies in thecreation of a qualitatively different social order, providingfundamental mutations of human and social life.  ,  For some years a cult figure of postmodern theory, Baudrillard movedbeyond the postmodern discourse from the early 1980s to thepresent, and has developed a highly idiosyncratic mode ofphilosophical and cultural analysis. This entry focuses on thedevelopment of Baudrillard's unique modes of thought and how he movedfrom social theory to postmodern theory to a provocative type ofphilosophical analysis.[1] In retrospect, Baudrillard can be seen a theorist who has traced inoriginal ways the life of signs and impact of technology on sociallife, and who has systematically criticized major modes of modernthought, while developing his own philosophical perspectives.},

In This Book Is Cheaper Than Therapy, seasoned therapist Liz Kelly brings the therapy office to you. So even if money is tight, your insurance doesn't cover therapy, you can't find quality practitioners in your area, or you've been stuck on a therapist's waitlist for months, you can still feel better now. With her cheeky humor, undeniable wit, and perfectly timed f-bombs, Liz has a talent for explaining complex mental health concepts in a way you can understand and can put into practice immediately. And don't worry...at no point in this book will you ever hear the phrase "healing journey," "your truth," or any other over-used therapy platitudes. Imagine if Tina Fey were your best friend and next-door neighbor...and she also just happened to be an experienced therapist. It is possible to feel better! Just take that first step and let Liz be your guide"--},

It is too expensive, ineffective, and impractical for many of the world's students. But how would you reinvent it for the twenty-first century -- how would you build it from the ground up? Many have speculated about changing higher education, but Minerva has actually created a new kind of university program. Its founders raised the funding, assembled the team, devised the curriculum and pedagogy, recruited the students, hired the faculty, and implemented a bold vision of a new and improved higher education. This book explains that vision and how it is being realized.The Minerva curriculum focuses on "practical knowledge" (knowledge students can use to adapt to a changing world); its pedagogy is based on scientific research on learning; it uses a novel technology platform to deliver small seminars in real time; and it offers a hybrid residential model where students live together, rotating through seven cities around the world. Minerva equips students with the cognitive tools they need to succeed in the world after graduation, building the core competencies of critical thinking, creative thinking, effective communication, and effective interaction. The book offers readers both the story of this grand and sweeping idea and a blueprint for transforming higher education.},

That is why a number of researchers have turned their full attention to the different aspects of this problem lately. However, there is no well-rounded theoretical and technical framework for approaching the problem to the best of our knowledge. We believe the existing lack of such clarity on the topic is due to its interdisciplinary nature that involves at its core both behavioral-economic topics as well as artificial intelligence. We dive deeper into the interdisciplinary nature and contribute to the formation of a clear frame of discussion. We review the related works that are about market prediction based on online-text-mining and produce a picture of the generic components that they all have. We, furthermore, compare each system with the rest and identify their main differentiating factors. Our comparative analysis of the systems expands onto the theoretical and technical foundations behind each. This work should help the research community to structure this emerging field and identify the exact aspects which require further research and are of special significance.},

  abstract = {In the World Wide Web environment, the information behavior model functions as a theoretical basis for constructing the information behavior tools. The traditional information behavior model is deduced from the generalization of the user behavior. However, this method has not enough strength to expose the essential cause which lies deeply inside the ordinary information behavior. To address this problem, it is necessary to redefine the meaning of information in the WWW environment. And through the result of this redefinition, it is possible to figure out the abstract model which can be regarded as the fundamental cause of information behavior. The information as an object of the information behavior is the set of the patterned signals. This proposition is discovered concurrently in cybernetics and information theory. Also, the WWW environment is consist of the documents and the linkages, in other words, of the simplified structure of the nodes and the edges. This structure has many similarities with the human linguistic behavior. Through these basses, it is assertible that the information behavior in the WWW environment is the structuring  documents, the set of pasteurized signals, in linguistic method. In the information behavior model of which the theoretical basis is derived from the Saussurian structural linguistics, the sets of documents are structured in the principle of syntagm and paradigm. The linguistic information behavior model grounded on the conceptualized characteristic of the information and the rule for the structuring the information behavior. Thus, the linguistic information behavior model can provide the fundamental methodology for the user interface architecture and the information retrieval system.},

Though many scholars have employed the concept in analyses, theoretical and operational definitions are exceedingly scattered and incoherent. Accordingly, the purpose of this project is to engender a detailed explication of interactivity that could bring some consensus to how the concept should be theoretically and operationally defined. Following Chaffee’s (1991) framework for concept explication, we generate new theoretical and operational definitions that may be central to future work in this area. In particular, we suggest that interactivity is both a media and psychological factor that varies across communication technologies, communication contexts, and people’s perceptions.},

  abstract = {This article argues that the computer game can be a locus of aesthetic form in contemporary culture. The context for understanding this claim is the decline of the artwork as bearer of form in the late 20th century, as this was understood by Adorno. Form is the enigmatic other of instrumental reason that emerges spontaneously in creative works and, in the modern era, is defined as that which makes them captivating and enigmatic yet resistant to analytic understanding. Clarification of the ways in which form is at work in game play is sought from aesthetic theory (Kant), ludology (or theory of games), and the idea of a neo-baroque entertainment culture (Ndalianis). Kant emphasized the role of play in the constitution of imaginary realms associated with aesthetic pleasure. Ludology takes play as an anthropological given differentiated historically by the development of game structures. Neo-baroque theory postulates a labyrinthine, complex and de-centred entertainment culture, largely shaped by computing as a cultural practice. The article synthesizes insights from these perspectives and, drawing on ideas from Adorno and Benjamin, argues that computer games can occupy an oppositional or critical role within contemporary aesthetics and culture. Reflection on the constitutive processes of computer game play discloses a new place for instrumental reason within aesthetic experience, as the dialectic of form and analysis migrates from traditional art materials to digital electronics.},

  abstract = {Toward the end of the nineteenth century, the hegemony of the printed word was shattered by the arrival of new media technologies that offered novel ways of communicating and storing data. Previously, writing had operated by way of symbolic mediation—all data had to pass through the needle’s eye of the written signifier—but phonography, photography, and cinematography stored physical effects of the real in the shape of sound waves and light. The entire question of referentiality had to be recast in light of these new media technologies; in addition, the use of the typewriter changed the perception of writing from that of a unique expression of a literate individual to that of a sequence of naked material signifiers.Part technological history of the emergent new media in the late nineteenth century, part theoretical discussion of the responses to these media—including texts by Rilke, Kafka, and Heidegger, as well as elaborations by Edison, Bell, Turing, and other innovators—Gramophone, Film, Typewriter analyzes this momentous shift using insights from the work of Foucault, Lacan, and McLuhan. Fusing discourse analysis, structuralist psychoanalysis, and media theory, the author adds a vital historical dimension to the current debates over the relationship between electronic literacy and poststructuralism, and the extent to which we are constituted by our technologies. The book ties the establishment of new discursive practices to the introduction of new media technologies, and it shows how both determine the ways in which psychoanalysis conceives of the psychic apparatus in terms of information machines.Gramophone, Film, Typewriter is, among other things, a continuation as well as a detailed elaboration of the second part of the author’s Discourse Networks, 1800/1900 (Stanford, 1990). As such, it bridges the gap between Kittler’s discourse analysis of the 1980’s and his increasingly computer-oriented work of the 1990’s.},

It is argued, first, that from Aristotle onwards ontology has dealt with the matter and form of things rather than the relations between things in time and space. Second, it is argued that because the Greeks did not distinguish between speech elements and alphabetic letters there has been a tendency for philosophy to neglect writing as its own technical medium. This paper traces these tendencies through a range of philosophical sources: from Aquinas and Descartes to Fichte and Hegel. It is argued, by way of response, that it is only with Heidegger that a philosophical consciousness for technical media first arose, and that today the connections of mathematics and media, and of media and ontology are to be formulated in more precise terms.},

  abstract = {Friedrich Kittler's lecture series provides a concise history of optical media from Renaissance linear perspective to late twentieth-century computer graphics. He begins by looking at European painting since the Renaissance in order to discern the principles according to which modern optical perception was organised. Kittler also discusses the development of various mechanical devices, like the camera obscura and the laterna magica, which were closely connected to the printing press and which played a pivotal role in the media war between the Reformation and the Counterreformation. After examining this history, Kittler then addresses the ways in which images were first stored and made to move through the development of photography and film. Kittler discusses the competitive relationship between photography and painting as well as between film and theater, as innovations like the Baroque proscenium or "picture-frame" stage evolved from elements that would later constitute cinema. The central question, however, is the impact of film on the ancient monopoly of writing, as it not only provoked new forms of competition for novelists but also fundamentally altered the status of books. In the final section, Kittler examines the development of electrical telecommunications and electronic image processing from television to computer simulations. In short, these lectures provide a comprehensive introduction to the history of image production, which is indispensable for anyone wishing to understand the prevailing audiovisual conditions of contemporary culture.},

"Media studies," as Kittler conceived it, meant reflecting on how books operate as films, poetry as computer science, and music as military equipment. This volume collects writings from all stages of the author's prolific career. Exemplary essays illustrate how matters of form and inscription make heterogeneous source material (e.g., literary classics and computer design) interchangeable on the level of function—with far-reaching consequences for our understanding of the humanities and the "hard sciences." Rich in counterintuitive propositions, sly humor, and vast erudition, Kittler's work both challenges the assumptions of positivistic cultural history and exposes the over-abstraction and language games of philosophers such as Heidegger and Derrida. The twenty-three pieces gathered here document the intellectual itinerary of one of the most original thinkers in recent times—sometimes baffling, often controversial, and always stimulating.},

  abstract = {In 1957 a few experimental European groups stemming from the radical tradition of dadaism and surrealism, but seeking to avoid the cooption to which those movements succumbed, came together to form the Situationist International. The name came from their aim of liberating everyday life through the creation of open-ended, participatory ?situations? (as opposed to fixed works of art) ? an aim which naturally ran up against the whole range of material and mental obstacles produced by the present social order. Over the next decade the situationists developed an increasingly incisive critique of the global ?spectacle-commodity system? and of its bureaucratic leftist pseudo-opposition, and their new methods of agitation helped trigger the May 1968 revolt in France. Since then ? although the SI itself was dissolved in 1972 ? situationist theories and tactics have continued to inspire radical currents in dozens of countries all over the world. The "SI Anthology," generally recognized as the most comprehensive and accurately translated collection of situationist writings in English, presents a chronological survey of the group's activities and development as reflected in articles from its French journal and in a variety of leaflets, pamphlets, filmscripts and internal documents, ranging from their early experiments in urban ?psychogeography? and cultural subversion to their lucid analyses of the Watts riot, the Vietnam war, the Prague Spring, the Chinese ?Cultural Revolution? and other crises and upheavals of the sixties.

  abstract = {The task of archiving was once entrusted only to museums, libraries, and other institutions that acted as repositories of culture in material form. But with the rise of digital networked media, a multitude of self-designated archivists -- fans, pirates, hackers -- have become practitioners of cultural preservation on the Internet. These nonprofessional archivists have democratized cultural memory, building freely accessible online archives of whatever content they consider suitable for digital preservation. In Rogue Archives, Abigail De Kosnik examines the practice of archiving in the transition from print to digital media, looking in particular at Internet fan fiction archives. De Kosnik explains that media users today regard all of mass culture as an archive, from which they can redeploy content for their own creations. Hence, "remix culture" and fan fiction are core genres of digital cultural production. De Kosnik explores, among other things, the anticanonical archiving styles of Internet preservationists; the volunteer labor of online archiving; how fan archives serve women and queer users as cultural resources; archivists' efforts to attract racially and sexually diverse content; and how digital archives adhere to the logics of performance more than the logics of print. She also considers the similarities and differences among free culture, free software, and fan communities, and uses digital humanities tools to quantify and visualize the size, user base, and rate of growth of several online fan archives.},

The articles, statements, and interviews collected here, produced over a period of twenty-four years, range over philosophy of language, anthropology, Marxism, and linguistics to discover the common principles that inform representation while negotiating the endlessly complex debates about art of the last two decades.Rooted in Freud, Wittgenstein, and French theory, Kosuth's work investigates the linguistic nature of art propositions and the role of social, institutional, psychological, and ethnological context. As a whole, his writings present a new definition of an expanded role and responsibility for the artist. Joseph Kosuth first received widespread notice at the Museum of Modern Art's "Information" exhibition and the Kunsthalle Bern's "When Attitudes Become Form" in the late 1960s. Today he is considered a founder of what has become known as conceptual art. His work appears in the permanent collections of many major museums.Gabriele Guercio is a doctoral candidate in art history at Yale University.},

  author = {Kozel, Susan},
  year = 2007,
  publisher = {MIT Press},
  abstract = {In Closer, Susan Kozel draws on live performance practice, digital technologies, and the philosophical approach of phenomenology. Trained in dance and philosophy, Kozel places the human body at the center of explorations of interactive interfaces, responsive systems, and affective computing, asking what can be discovered as we become closer to our computers—as they become extensions of our ways of thinking, moving, and touching.Performance, Kozel argues, can act as a catalyst for understanding wider social and cultural uses of digital technology. Taking this one step further, performative acts of sharing the body through our digital devices foster a collaborative construction of new physical states, levels of conscious awareness, and even ethics. We reencounter ourselves and others through our interactive computer systems. What we need now are conceptual and methodological frameworks to reflect this.Kozel offers a timely reworking of the phenomenology of French philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty. This method, based on a respect for lived experience, begins by listening to the senses and noting insights that arrive in the midst of dance, or quite simply in the midst of life. The combination of performance and phenomenology offered by Closer yields entwinements between experience and reflection that shed light on, problematize, or restructure scholarly approaches to human bodies using digital technologies.After outlining her approach and methodology and clarifying the key concepts of performance, technologies, and virtuality, Kozel applies phenomenological method to the experience of designing and performing in a range of computational systems: telematics, motion capture, responsive architectures, and wearable computing.The transformative potential of the alchemy between bodies and technologies is the foundation of Closer. With careful design, future generations of responsive systems and mobile devices can expand our social, physical, and emotional exchanges.},

  abstract = {Since the 1970s, the South African artist William Kentridge has charted the turbulent terrain of his homeland in both personal and political terms. With erudition, absurdist humor, and an underlying hope in humankind, Kentridge's artwork has examined apartheid, humanitarian atrocities, aging, and the ambiguities of growing up white and Jewish in South Africa. This October Files volume brings together critical essays and interviews that explore Kentridge's work and shed light on the unique working processes behind his drawings, prints, stop-animation films, and theater works. The texts include an interview by the artist Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev, curator of the first major retrospective of Kentridge's work; an essay by Andreas Huyssen on the role of shadow-play in Kentridge's film series 9 Drawing for Projection; and investigations of Kentridge's work for opera and theater by Maria Gough, Joseph Leo Koerner, and Margaret Koster Koerner. An analysis by influential art historian Rosalind Krauss, the editor of this volume, argues that Kentridge's films are the result of a particularly reflexive drawing practice in which the marks on the page--particularly the smudges, smears, and erasures that characterize his stop-animations--define the act of drawing as a temporal medium. Krauss's understanding of Kentridge's work as embodying a fundamental tension between formal and sociological poles has been crucial to subsequent analyses of the artist's work, including the new essay by the anthropologist Rosalind Morris, who has collaborated with Kentridge on several projects" -- From the publisher},

You'll learn about the primitives of music such as notes and duration, the means of combining those primitives into motives and chords, operations such as transposition, retrograde, and inversion, and the means of abstraction (phrases and form) using Python and some basic math.

  abstract = {A good book may have the power to change the way we see the world, but a great book actually becomes part of our daily consciousness, pervading our thinking to the point that we take it for granted, and we forget how provocative and challenging its ideas once were—and still are. The Structure of Scientific Revolutions is that kind of book. When it was first published in 1962, it was a landmark event in the history and philosophy of science. Fifty years later, it still has many lessons to teach.  With The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, Kuhn challenged long-standing linear notions of scientific progress, arguing that transformative ideas don’t arise from the day-to-day, gradual process of experimentation and data accumulation but that the revolutions in science, those breakthrough moments that disrupt accepted thinking and offer unanticipated ideas, occur outside of “normal science,” as he called it. Though Kuhn was writing when physics ruled the sciences, his ideas on how scientific revolutions bring order to the anomalies that amass over time in research experiments are still instructive in our biotech age.  This new edition of Kuhn’s essential work in the history of science includes an insightful introduction by Ian Hacking, which clarifies terms popularized by Kuhn, including paradigm and incommensurability, and applies Kuhn’s ideas to the science of today. Usefully keyed to the separate sections of the book, Hacking’s introduction provides important background information as well as a contemporary context. ~Newly designed, with an expanded index, this edition will be eagerly welcomed by the next generation of readers seeking to understand the history of our perspectives on science.},

  abstract = {This article proposes a novel framework for the real-time capture, assessment, and visualization of ballet dance movements as performed by a student in an instructional, virtual reality (VR) setting. The acquisition of human movement data is facilitated by skeletal joint tracking captured using the popular Microsoft (MS) Kinect camera system, while instruction and performance evaluation are provided in the form of 3D visualizations and feedback through a CAVE virtual environment, in which the student is fully immersed. The proposed framework is based on the unsupervised parsing of ballet dance movement into a structured posture space using the spherical self-organizing map (SSOM). A unique feature descriptor is proposed to more appropriately reflect the subtleties of ballet dance movements, which are represented as gesture trajectories through posture space on the SSOM. This recognition subsystem is used to identify the category of movement the student is attempting when prompted (by a virtual instructor) to perform a particular dance sequence. The dance sequence is then segmented and cross-referenced against a library of gestural components performed by the teacher. This facilitates alignment and score-based assessment of individual movements within the context of the dance sequence. An immersive interface enables the student to review his or her performance from a number of vantage points, each providing a unique perspective and spatial context suggestive of how the student might make improvements in training. An evaluation of the recognition and virtual feedback systems is presented.},

  abstract = {Jacques Lacan is widely recognized as a key figure in the history of psychoanalysis and one of the most influential thinkers of the 20th Century. In Anxiety, now available for the first time in English, he explores the nature of anxiety, suggesting that it is not nostalgia for the object that causes anxiety but rather its imminence. In what was to be the last of his year-long seminars at Saint-Anne hospital, Lacan's 1962-63 lessons form the keystone to this classic phase of his teaching. Here we meet for the first time the notorious a in its oral, anal, scopic and vociferated guises, alongside Lacan’s exploration of the question of the 'analyst's desire'. Arriving at these concepts from a multitude of angles, Lacan leads his audience with great care through a range of recurring themes such as anxiety between jouissance and desire, counter-transference and interpretation, and the fantasy and its frame. This important volume, which forms Book X of The Seminar of Jacques Lacan, will be of great interest to students and practitioners of psychoanalysis and to students and scholars throughout the humanities and social sciences, from literature and critical theory to sociology, psychology and gender studies.},

Delving into the psychoanalyst's inevitable involvement with ethical questions and "the attraction of transgression," Lacan illuminates Freud's psychoanalytic work and its continued influence. Lacan explores the problem of sublimation, the paradox of jouissance, the essence of tragedy (a reading of Sophocle's Antigone), and the tragic dimension of analytic experience. His exploration leads us to startling insights on "the consequence of man's relationship to desire" and the conflicting judgments of ethics and analysis.},

Taking us into and beyond the realm of Freudian psychoanalysis, Lacan examines the psychoses' inescapable connection to the symbolic process through which signifier is joined with signified. Lacan deftly navigates the ontological levels of the symbolic, the imaginary, and the real to explain psychosis as "foreclosure," or rejection of the primordial signifier. Then, bridging the gap between the theoretical and the practical, Lacan discusses the implications for treatment. In these lectures on the psychoses, Lacan's renowned theory of metaphor and metonymy, along with the concept of the "quilting point," appears for the first time.},

He follows in the footsteps of Niklas Luhmann, yet in marked contrast with his ‘sociological master’ Baecker also gives ample attention to the notion of culture. This paper first summarizes some of the main lines in his writings on the notion of culture and on contemporary culture. It then continues with a succinct presentation of Baecker’s approach to artistic communication against the background of this more general characterization of the relationship between the individual and society, conscious sensory perception and communication, in terms of an ‘aesthetic coupling’. It will be shown that a recurrent figure of thought links up Baecker’s various considerations on culture and art, i.e. the inclusion of the excluded.},

Digital mapping interfaces invite us to touch, talk and move with them, actions that have a reciprocal effect on the look of the image of the map. Images change constantly through absorbing our mobile and physical actions. I approach digital mapping interfaces as mediators: They do not so much collect information as create spatial transformations for the user of the interface, thus instigating new moves on his or her part that are fed once again into the interface. I argue that it is therefore short-sighted to view digital mapping interfaces as mere points of passage. They are better understood as mediators that create spatial meanings by translating between and inviting movements of users, vehicles, programs and so on.},

  abstract = {Following in the wake of his groundbreaking War in the Age of Intelligent Machines, Manuel De Landa presents a radical synthesis of historical development over the last one thousand years. More than a simple expository history, A Thousand Years of Nonlinear History sketches the outlines of a renewed materialist philosophy of history in the tradition of Fernand Braudel, Gilles Deleuze, and Félix Guattari, while also engaging the critical new understanding of material processes derived from the sciences of dynamics. Working against prevailing attitudes that see history as an arena of texts, discourses, ideologies, and metaphors, De Landa traces the concrete movements and interplays of matter and energy through human populations in the last millennium.De Landa attacks three domains that have given shape to human societies: economics, biology, and linguistics. In every case, what one sees is the self-directed processes of matter and energy interacting with the whim and will of human history itself to form a panoramic vision of the West free of rigid teleology and naive notions of progress, and even more important, free of any deterministic source of its urban, institutional, and technological forms. Rather, the source of all concrete forms in the West's history are shown to derive from internal morphogenetic capabilities that lie within the flow of matter-energy itself.},

  abstract = {In the aftermath of the methodical destruction of Iraq during the Persian                 Gulf War, the power and efficiency of new computerized weapons and surveillance                 technology have become chillingly apparent. For Manuel DeLanda, however, this new                 weaponry has a significance that goes far beyond military applications; he shows how                 it represents a profound historical shift in the relation of human beings both to                 machines and to information. The recent emergence of intelligent and autonomous                 bombs and missiles equipped with artificial perception and decision-making                 capabilities is, for Delanda, part of a much larger transfer of cognitive structures                 from humans to machines in the late twentieth century.War in the Age of Intelligent                 Machines provides a rich panorama of these astonishing developments; it details the                 mutating history of information analysis and machinic organization from the mobile                 siege artillery of the Renaissance, the clockwork armies of the Thirty Years War,                 the Napoleonic campaigns, and the Nazi blitzkrieg up to present-day cybernetic                 battle-management systems and satellite reconnaissance networks. Much more than a                 history of warfare, DeLanda's account is an unprecedented philosophical and                 historical reflection on the changing forms through which human bodies and materials                 are combined, organized, deployed, and made effective.Manuel DeLanda has published                 essays on philosophy and film theory.

The instrument used to display the Oscillons, the cathode ray oscilloscope, is described and its various functions discussed. Basic waveforms which may be displayed are illustrated and explained. Some of the means by which oscilloscope traces may be combined and controlled to form Oscillons are briefly outlined and several examples are shown. The kinetic nature of many Oscillons is brought out. The author briefly describes methods of composing them as art forms and the photography of the electronic abstractions is explained, including some problems involved. Exhibitions and publications of the Oscillons are noted. A review is made of the author's interest in designs derived from mathematical, physical and technical sources which led up to his Oscillon project. The first suggested use of them for design is mentioned, along with work of others in this field. They are compared to other kinds of non-figurative and mathematical art, and some relationships considered. A comparison is made to electronic music. The author concludes that the Oscillons are a good example of the use of technology for art and as manifestations of natural phenomena. /// L'article décrit les Oscillons ou abstractions électroniques, en tant qu'oscillogrammes électroniques composés dans un but artistique.

  abstract = {In this groundbreaking editorial and curatorial project, more than 100 writers, artists, and philosophers rethink what politics is about. In a time of political turmoil and anticlimax, this book redefines politics as operating in the realm of things. Politics is not just an arena, a profession, or a system, but a concern for things brought to the attention of the fluid and expansive constituency of the public. But how are things made public? What, we might ask, is a republic, a res publica, a public thing, if we do not know how to make things public? There are many other kinds of assemblies, which are not political in the usual sense, that gather a public around things -- scientific laboratories, supermarkets, churches, and disputes involving natural resources like rivers, landscapes, and air. The authors of Making Things Public -- and the ZKM show that the book accompanies -- ask what would happen if politics revolved around disputed things. Instead of looking for democracy only in the official sphere of professional politics, they examine the new atmospheric conditions -- technologies, interfaces, platforms, networks, and mediations that allow things to be made public. They show us that the old definition of politics is too narrow; there are many techniques of representation -- in politics, science, and art -- of which Parliaments and Congresses are only a part. The authors include such prominent thinkers as Richard Rorty, Simon Schaffer, Peter Galison, Richard Powers, Lorraine Daston, Richard Aczel, and Donna Haraway; their writings are accompanied by excerpts from John Dewey, Shakespeare, Swift, La Fontaine, and Melville. More than 500 color images document the new idea of what Bruno Latour and Peter Weibel call an "object-oriented democracy."},

  abstract = {Science and technology have immense authority and influence in our society, yet their working remains little understood. The conventional perception of science in Western societies has been modified in recent years by the work of philosophers, sociologists and historians of science. In this book Bruno Latour brings together these different approaches to provide a lively and challenging analysis of science, demonstrating how social context and technical content are both essential to a proper understanding of scientific activity. Emphasizing that science can only be understood through its practice, the author examines science and technology in action: the role of scientific literature, the activities of laboratories, the institutional context of science in the modern world, and the means by which inventions and discoveries become accepted. From the study of scientific practice he develops an analysis of science as the building of networks. Throughout, Bruno Latour shows how a lively and realistic picture of science in action alters our conception of not only the natural sciences but also the social sciences and the sociology of knowledge in general.    This stimulating book, drawing on a wealth of examples from a wide range of scientific activities, will interest all philosophers, sociologists and historians of science, scientists and engineers, and students of the philosophy of social science and the sociology of knowledge.},

  abstract = {"Capital is a semiotic operator": this assertion by Félix Guattari is at the heart of Maurizio Lazzarato's  Signs and Machines, which asks us to leave behind the logocentrism that still informs so many critical theories. Lazzarato calls instead for a new theory capable of explaining how signs function in the economy, in power apparatuses, and in the production of subjectivity.Moving beyond the dualism of signifier and signified,  Signs and Machines shows how signs act as "sign-operators" that enter directly into material flows and into the functioning of machines. Money, the stock market, price differentials, algorithms, and scientific equations and formulas constitute semiotic "motors" that make capitalism's social and technical machines run, bypassing representation and consciousness to produce social subjections and semiotic enslavements.Lazzarato contrasts Deleuze and Guattari's complex semiotics with the political theories of Jacques Rancière, Antonio Negri and Michael Hardt, Paolo Virno, and Judith Butler, for whom language and the public space it opens still play a fundamental role. Lazzarato asks: What are the conditions necessary for political and existential rupture at a time when the production of subjectivity represents the primary and perhaps most important work of capitalism? What are the specific tools required to undo the industrial mass production of subjectivity undertaken by business and the state? What types of organization must we construct for a process of subjectivation that would allow us to escape the hold of social subjection and machinic enslavement? In addressing these questions,  Signs and Machines takes on a task that is today more urgent than ever.},

Neil Leach lays out five sections composing the predominant schools of twentieth century thought.

The selection of writings is contextualized by an introduction - itself a significant contribution to the interpretation of Henri Lefebvre's work - which places the material within the context of Lefebvre's intellectual and political life and times and raises pertinent issues as to their relevance for contemporary debates over such questions as the nature of urban reality, the production of space and modernity.  Writings on Cities is of particular relevance to architects, planners, geographers, and those interested in the philosophical and political understanding of contemporary life.},

  abstract = {Drawings and short essays offer engaging and accessible explanations of key ideas in physics, from triangulation to relativity and beyond.Humans have been trying to understand the physical universe since antiquity. Aristotle had one vision (the realm of the celestial spheres is perfect), and Einstein another (all motion is relativistic). More often than not, these different understandings begin with a simple drawing, a pre-mathematical picture of reality. Such drawings are a humble but effective tool of the physicist's craft, part of the tradition of thinking, teaching, and learning passed down through the centuries. This book uses drawings to help explain fifty-one key ideas of physics accessibly and engagingly. Don Lemons, a professor of physics and author of several physics books, pairs short, elegantly written essays with simple drawings that together convey important concepts from the history of physical science.Lemons proceeds chronologically, beginning with Thales' discovery of triangulation, the Pythagorean monocord, and Archimedes' explanation of balance. He continues through Leonardo's description of "earthshine" (the ghostly glow between the horns of a crescent moon), Kepler's laws of planetary motion, and Newton's cradle (suspended steel balls demonstrating by their collisions that for every action there is always an equal and opposite reaction). Reaching the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, Lemons explains the photoelectric effect, the hydrogen atom, general relativity, the global greenhouse effect, Higgs boson, and more. The essays place the science of the drawings in historical context -- describing, for example, Galileo's conflict with the Roman Catholic Church over his teaching that the sun is the center of the universe, the link between the discovery of electrical phenomena and the romanticism of William Wordsworth, and the shadow cast by the Great War over Einstein's discovery of relativity. Readers of Drawing Physics with little background in mathematics or physics will say, "Now I see, and now I understand."},

From their inceptions, these two notions have been essentially disconnected because each has defined its own language and tools. Here we demonstrate the existence of a deep conceptual link between (M,R) systems and Autopoietic systems. This relationship permits us to posit that Autopoietic systems, which have been advanced as capturing the central aspects of living systems, are a subset of (M,R) systems. This result, in conjunction with previous theorems proved by Rosen, can be used to outline a demonstration that the operation of Autopoietic systems cannot be simulated by Turing machines. This powerful result shows the potential of linking these two models. Finally, we suggest that the formalism of (M,R) systems could be used to model the circularity of metabolism.},

  abstract = {"A call to reform our antiquated political institutions before it's too late-from the New York Times bestselling authors of How Democracies Die. America is undergoing a massive experiment: It is moving, in fits and starts, toward a multiracial democracy, something few societies have ever done. But the prospect of change has sparked an authoritarian backlash that threatens the very foundations of our political system. Why is democracy under assault here, and not in other wealthy, diversifying nations? And what can we do to save it? With the clarity and brilliance that made their first book, How Democracies Die, a global bestseller, Harvard professors Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt offer a coherent framework for understanding these volatile times. They draw on a wealth of examples-from 1930s France to present-day Thailand-to explain why and how political parties turn against democracy. They then show how our Constitution makes us uniquely vulnerable to attacks from within: It is a pernicious enabler of minority rule, allowing partisan minorities to consistently thwart and even rule over popular majorities. Most modern democracies-from Germany and Sweden to Argentina and New Zealand-have eliminated outdated institutions like elite upper chambers, indirect elections, and lifetime tenure for judges. The United States lags dangerously behind. In this revelatory book, Levitsky and Ziblatt issue an urgent call to perfect our national experiment. It's a daunting task, but we have remade our country before-most notably, after the Civil War and during the Progressive Era. And now we are at a crossroads: America will either become a multiracial democracy or cease to be a democracy at all"--},

  abstract = {From ARToolkit’s emergence in the 1990s to the emergence of augmented reality (AR) as an art medium in the 2010s, AR has developed as a number of evidential sites. As an extension of virtual media, it merges real-time pattern recognition with goggles (finally realizing William Gibson’s sci-fi fantasy) or handheld devices. This creates a welding of real-time media and virtual reality, or an optically registered simulation overlaid upon an actual spatial environment. Commercial applications are numerous, including entertainment, sales, and navigation. Even though AR-based works can be traced back to the late 1990s, AR work requires some understanding of coding and tethered imaging equipment. It was not until marker-based AR, affording lower entries to usage, as well as geo-locational AR-based media, using handheld devices and tablets, that augmented reality as an art medium would propagate. While one can argue that AR-based art is a convergence of handheld device art and virtual reality, there are intrinsic gestures specific to augmented reality that make it unique. The author looks at some historical examples of AR as well as critical issues of AR-based gestures such as compounding the gaze, problematizing the retinal, and the representational issues of informatic overlays. This generates four gestural vectors, analogous to those defined in “The Translation of Art in Virtual Worlds,” which is examined through case studies. From this, a visual theory of augmentation will be proposed.},

It also states that the term is used "in the names of certain massacres of history". The first recorded use in English of the word massacre in the name of an event is due to Christopher Marlow who in c. 1600 referred to what is now known as the  St. Bartholomew's Day massacre as "The massacre at Paris"The purpose of the list is to trace such of the term "massacre" specifically. There are many alternative terms with similar connotations, such as butchery, carnage,  bloodbath, mass killing, atrocity, etc. as well as euphemisms such as Vespers, Blutgericht or "attack", "incident", "tragedy" (etc.), use of which are outside the scope of this list. Massacre is also used figuratively to describe dramatic events that did not involve any deaths, such as the "Hilo massacre" and the "Saturday Night Massacre"; this usage is also outside of the scope of this list. Massacres after 1945 are listed separately because of inflationary use in journalism after the turn of the 20th century.},

Liu offers here the first rigorous study of the political history of digital writing and its fateful entanglement with the Freudian unconscious. ~~~~~~~~~~~ Liu’s innovative analysis brings the work of theorists and writers back into conversation with one another to document significant meetings of minds and disciplines. She shows how the earlier avant-garde literary experiments with alphabetical writing and the word-association games of psychoanalysis contributed to the mathematical making of digital media. Such intellectual convergence, she argues, completed the transformation of alphabetical writing into the postphonetic, ideographic system of digital media, which not only altered the threshold of sense and nonsense in communication processes but also compelled a new understanding of human-machine interplay at the level of the unconscious. ~~~~~~~~~~~ Ranging across information theory, cybernetics, modernism, literary theory, neurotic machines, and psychoanalysis, The Freudian Robot rewrites the history of digital media and the literary theory of the twentieth century.},

The topics range over all areas and periods of Greek science, from the earliest Presocratic philosophers to Ptolemy and Galen. In each case the article is preceded by an introduction that assesses scholarly debate on the topic since the original publication.

  abstract = {The author articulates and defends a buck passing theory of art, namely that a work of art is nothing but a work in one of the arts. Having traced philosophical interest in theories of art to a reaction to certain puzzle cases of avant-garde art, he argues that none of the theories that have dominated philosophy since the 1960s adequately copes with these works. Whereas these theories have reached a dialectical impasse wherein they reiterate, and cannot resolve, disagreement over the puzzle cases, the buck passing theory illuminates the radical provocations of avant-garde art. In addition, when supplemented by a systematic framework for crafting theories of the individual arts, the buck passing theory grounds our empirical inquiries into the arts as well as our practices of appreciation and art criticism. Lopes seeks to model the diverse strategies employed by humanists and social and behavioural scientists who study the different arts. He gives the specificity of each art form a central role in our appreciative endeavours, and yet he stresses the continuity of the arts with similar, non-art activities such as fashion design, sports and games, cuisine, nature appreciation, and non-literary writing.--},

Do the concepts we usually employ to talk about art, such as ‘meaning’, ‘form’ or ‘expression’ apply to computer art? ~  A Philosophy of Computer Art is the first book to explore these questions. Dominic Lopes argues that computer art challenges some of the basic tenets of traditional ways of thinking about and making art and that to understand computer art we need to place particular emphasis on terms such as ‘interactivity’ and ‘user’.  Drawing on a wealth of examples he also explains how the roles of the computer artist and computer art user distinguishes them from makers and spectators of traditional art forms and argues that computer art allows us to understand better the role of technology as an art medium.},

I was trying to draw the attention of the American Left, which still believed in Eurocommunism, to the fate of Autonomia. The survival of the last politically creative movement in the West was at stake, but no one in the United States seemed to realize that, or be willing to listen. Put together as events in Italy were unfolding, the Autonomia issue—which has no equivalent in Italy, or anywhere for that matter—arrived too late, but it remains an energizing account of a movement that disappeared without bearing a trace, but with a big future still ahead of it.—Sylvere LotringerSemiotext(e) is reissuing in book form its legendary magazine issue Autonomia: Post-Political Politics, originally published in New York in 1980. Edited by Sylvere Lotringer and Christian Marazzi with the direct participation of the main leaders and theorists of the Autonomist movement (including Antonio Negri, Mario Tronti, Franco Piperno, Oreste Scalzone, Paolo Virno, Sergio Bologna, and Franco Berardi), this volume is the only first-hand document and contemporaneous analysis that exists of the most innovative post-'68 radical movement in the West. The movement itself was broken when Autonomia members were falsely accused of (and prosecuted for) being the intellectual masterminds of the Red Brigades; but even after the end of Autonomia, this book remains a crucial testimony of the way this creative, futuristic, neo-anarchistic, postideological, and nonrepresentative political movement of young workers and intellectuals anticipated issues that are now confronting us in the wake of Empire. In the next two years, Semiotext(e) will publish eight books by such Italian "Post-Fordist" intellectuals as Antonio Negri, Christian Marazzi, Paolo Virno, and Bifo, as they update the theories of Autonomia for the new century.},

Looking in detail at Benjamin’s celebrated but often mysterious text, and restoring the philosophical, theological and political context, Löwy highlights the complex relationship between redemption and revolution in Benjamin’s philosophy of history.},

He traces the development of the notion of "environment" from the medieval idea—which encompasses both human and natural systems—to our modern definition, which separates social systems from the external environment.  In Luhmann's thought, human beings form part of the environment, while social systems consist only of communications. Utilizing this distinctive theoretical perspective, Luhmann presents a comprehensive catalog of society's reactions to environmental problems. He investigates the spheres of the economy, law, science, politics, religion, and education to show how these areas relate to environmental issues.  Ecological Communication is an important work that critically examines claims central to our society—claims to modernity and rationality. It will be of great importance to scholars and students in sociology, political science, philosophy, anthropology, and law.},

Through his many books he developed a highly original form of systems theory that has been hugely influential in a wide variety of disciplines. In Introduction to Systems Theory, Luhmann explains the key ideas of general and sociological systems theory and supplies a wealth of examples to illustrate his approach. The book offers a wide range of concepts and theorems that can be applied to politics and the economy, religion and science, art and education, organization and the family. Moreover, Luhmann’s ideas address important contemporary issues in such diverse fields as cognitive science, ecology, and the study of social movements. This book provides all the necessary resources for readers to work through the foundations of systems theory – no other work by Luhmann is as clear and accessible as this. There is also much here that will be of great interest to more advanced scholars and practitioners in sociology and the social sciences.},

Luhmann argues that current thinking about how law operates within a modern society is seriously deficient. In this volume he lays out the theoretical and methodological tools that, he argues, can advance our understanding of contemporary society and, in particular, of the identity, performance, and function of the legal system within that society. In systems theory, society is its communications: they are its empirical reality; the items that can be observed and studied. Systems theory identifies how communications operate within a physical world and how different sub-systems of communication operate alongside each other. In this volume, Luhmann uses systems theory to address a question central to legal theory: what differentiates law from other parts of society?},

After a brief introduction to early theories of distinction, the central ideas of Spencer-Brown’s Laws of Form as the most radical form of differential thinking are presented. For Luhmann’s systems theory, this has four important consequences. First, the system is the difference between system and environment. Second, the system can be defined through a single mode of operation. Third, every (social) system observes internally (i.e. within the system) its own system/environment distinction; there is a re-entry of the system/environment distinction into the system. Fourth, every social theory is part of the social domain and as such part of what it describes.},

One of Luhmann's most important projects, it exemplifies his later work while redefining the subject matter of the sociology of religion. Religion, for Luhmann, is one of the many functionally differentiated social systems that make up modern society. All such subsystems consist entirely of communications and all are "autopoietic," which is to say, self-organizing and self-generating. Here, Luhmann explains how religion provides a code for coping with the complexity, opacity, and uncontrollability of our world. Religion functions to make definite the indefinite, to reconcile the immanent and the transcendent.Synthesizing approaches as disparate as the philosophy of language, historical linguistics, deconstruction, and formal systems theory/cybernetics, A Systems Theory of Religion takes on important topics that range from religion's meaning and evolution to secularization, turning decades of sociological assumptions on their head. It provides us with a fresh vocabulary and a fresh philosophical and sociological approach to one of society's most fundamental phenomena.},

The work of conceptual artist Sophie Calle embraces numerous media: photography, storytelling, film, and memoir, to name a few. Often controversial, Calle's projects explore issues of voyeurism, intimacy, and identity as she secretly investigates, reconstructs and documents the lives of strangers - whether she is inviting them to sleep in her bed, trailing them through a hotel, or following them through the city. Taking on multiple roles - detective, documentarian, behavioral scientist and diarist - Calle turns the interplay between life and art on its head. The book presents Calle's best-known works, including "The Blind", "No Sex Last Night", "The Hotel", "The Address Book" and "A Woman Vanishes", as well as lesser known and earlier projects that have largely escaped the public eye. The book also includes diary excerpts and video stills, along with three critical essays, a revealing interview with the artist and a dialogue with fellow artist Damien Hirst.},

They also share an emphasis on the                 complexity of technological formation and fixation and on the role of belief                 (especially self-validating belief) in technological change.Two                 of the articles won major prizes on their original journal publication, and all but                 one date from 1991 or later. A substantial new introduction outlines the common                 themes underlying this body of work and places it in the context of recent debates                 in technology studies. Two conceptual essays are followed by seven empirical essays                 focusing on the laser gyroscopes that are central to modern aircraft navigation                 technology, supercomputers (with a particular emphasis on their use in the design of                 nuclear weapons), the application of mathematical proof in the design of computer                 systems, computer-related accidental deaths, and the nature of the knowledge that is                 needed to design a nuclear bomb.},

The author considers the expanding fields of astronomical and astrophysical knowledge to which such data analysis has given rise. She suggests that the data that makes such imaging possible moves us further from conventions of the optical real toward an algorithmic realism, alluding to time-scales that delimit and circumvent human time. Thus Cartesian metaphysics is displaced—the human becomes one agent among many in a process of algorithmic inference.},

  abstract = {The article aims at investigating the persistence and comeback of old media technologies (phenomena we define, in short, 'retromedia') by developing a distinctive theoretical approach named retromedia-in-practice and based on practice theory. Far from being abandoned and forgotten, many old media devices and artefacts (such as vinyl records, cassette tapes, analogue photographic cameras, early videogames and brick mobile phones, to mention just a few notable examples) are nowadays readopted by young generations and niche media subcultures. However, most of the existing literature focusing on these cases has limits and shortfalls, resulting in a partial and misleading understanding of these phenomena: scholars and theorists often put at the centre the cultural fascination for vintage objects and the nostalgia effect; other studies rely on a taken-for-granted distinction between old and new media; the relational and processual nature of media change is rarely addressed; and in general, research lacks a framework capable of adequately integrating symbolic processes with material and technological features. In order to cope with these shortfalls, the article adopts the approach of practice theory, which enables to focus not on the media themselves, but on the practices associated with them. After presenting the distinctive framework of analysis, we exemplify our approach by analysing three different cases coming from music (vinyl records), photography (Polaroid-like instant photography) and videogaming (the 'consolization' of old arcade games). These case studies rely on original empirical data coming from authors' qualitative research. The article concludes by arguing that a shift from considering retromedia as objects or discourses to retromedia-in-practice allows to both address the processual nature of retromedia and propose an interpretation that keeps together media materiality, their meanings and also the embodied activities and behaviours that are attached to them.}

  publisher = {Oxford University Press, USA},
  abstract = {Few Americans and even fewer citizens of other nations understand the electoral process in the United States. Still fewer understand the role played by political parties in the electoral process or the ironies within the system. Participation in elections in the United States is much lower than in the vast majority of mature democracies. Perhaps this is because of the lack of competition in a country where only two parties have a true chance of winning, despite the fact that a large number of citizens claim allegiance to neither and think badly of both. Or perhaps it is because in the U.S. campaign contributions disproportionately favor incumbents in most legislative elections, or that largely unregulated groups such as the now notorious 527s have as much impact on the outcome of a campaign as do the parties or the candidates' campaign organizations. Studying these factors, you begin to get a very clear picture indeed of the problems that underlay our much trumpeted electoral system. This Very Short Introduction introduces the reader to these issues and more, providing an insider's view of how the system actually works while shining a light on some of its flaws. As we enter what is sure to be yet another highly contested election year, it is more important than ever that Americans take the time to learn the system that puts so many in power. ABOUT THE SERIES: The Very Short Introductions series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area. These pocket-sized books are the perfect way to get ahead in a new subject quickly. Our expert authors combine facts, analysis, perspective, new ideas, and enthusiasm to make interesting and challenging topics highly readable.},

  abstract = {While earlier reproduction technologies such as woodblock printing, moveable type printing, lithography, and photography represented media in ways accessible to bare senses, the media technologies of the late 19th century abandoned these formats in favor of an electrical signal. Simultaneously, they also introduced a fundamentally new dimension of media – interface (i.e. the ways to represent and control the signal). And this in its turn changed how media functions – its ‘properties’ were no longer solely contained in the data but were now also dependent on the interfaces provided by technology manufacturers. The shift to digital data and media software a hundred years later extends this principle further. With all types of data now encoded as sets of numbers, they can only be efficiently accessed by users via software applications. As a result, the ‘properties’ of digital media (how it can be edited, shared, and analyzed) are now defined by the particular software as opposed to solely being contained in the actual content (i.e. digital files).},

  abstract = {"No one has ever described American democracy with more accurate insight or more profoundly than Alexis de Tocqueville. After meeting with Americans on extensive travels in the United States, and intense study of documents and authorities, he authored the landmark Democracy in America, publishing its two volumes in 1835 and 1840. Ever since, this book has been the best source for every serious attempt to understand America and democracy itself. Yet Tocqueville himself remains a mystery behind the elegance of his style. Now one of our leading authorities on Tocqueville explains him in this splendid new entry in Oxford's acclaimed Very Short Introduction series. Harvey Mansfield addresses his subject as a thinker, clearly and incisively exploring Tocqueville's writings--not only his masterpiece, but also his secret Recollections, intended for posterity alone, and his unfinished work on his native France, The Old Regime and the Revolution. Tocqueville was a liberal, Mansfield writes, but not of the usual sort. The many elements of his life found expression in his thought: his aristocratic ancestry, his ventures in politics, his voyages abroad, his hopes and fears for America, and his disappointment with France. All his writings show a passion for political liberty and insistence on human greatness. Perhaps most important, he saw liberty not in theories, but in the practice of self-government in America. Ever an opponent of abstraction, he offered an analysis that forces us to consider what we actually do in our politics--suggesting that theory itself may be an enemy of freedom. And that, Mansfield writes, makes him a vitally important thinker for today. Translator of an authoritative edition of Democracy in America, Harvey Mansfield here offers the fruit of decades of research and reflection in a clear, insightful, and marvelously compact introduction"--},

  publisher = {Taylor \& Francis},
  abstract = {Edited by Douglas Kellner, Art and Liberation is the fourth volume of Herbert Marcuse's collected papers. The role of art is Marcuse's work has often been neglected, misinterpreted or underplayed. His critics accused him of a religion of art and aesthetics that leads to an escape from politics and society. Yet, as this volume demonstrates, Marcuse analyses culture and art in the context of how it produces forces of domination and resistance in society, and his writings on culture and art generate the possibility of liberation and radical social transformation.The material in this volume is a rich collection of many of Marcuse's published and unpublished writings, interviews and talks, including 'Ž\textasciitilde Lyric Poetry after Auschwitz', reflections on Proust, and Letters on Surrealism; a poem by Samuel Beckett for Marcuse's eightieth birthday with exchange of letters; and many articles that explore the role of art in society and how it provides possibilities for liberation.This volume will be of interest to those new to Marcuse, generally acknowledged as a major figure in the intellectual and social milieus of the 1960s and 1970s, as well as to the specialist, giving access to a wealth of material from the Marcuse Archive in Frankfurt and his private collection in San Diego, some of it published here in English for the first time.A comprehensive Introduction by Douglas Kellner reflects on the genesis, development, and tensions within Marcuse's aesthetic, while an afterword by Gerhard Schweppenhäuser summarizes their relevance for the contemporary era.},

  year = 1998,
  publisher = {Routledge},
  abstract = {Acclaimed throughout the world as a philosopher of liberation and revolution, Herbert Marcuse is one of the most influential thinkers of the twentieth century. His penetrating critiques of the ways modern technology produces forms of society and culture with oppressive modes of social control indicate his enduring significance in the contemporary moment. This collection of unpublished or uncollected essays, unfinished manuscripts, and correspondence between 1942 and 1951, provides Marcuse's exemplary attempts to link theory with practice, and develops ideas that can be used to grasp and transform existing social reality.These papers vividly chronicle Marcuse's increasing, yet reluctant estrangement from Max Horkeimer, director of the Institute for Social Research and his years as an analyst with various U.S. government agencies. Marcuse's later attempts to link theory and practice in the 1960s and 1970s in regard to the New Left, National Liberation Movements and other new social movements were grounded in his work from the 1940s. As the 1940s witnessed the rise to global prominence of German fascism and its defeat in World War Two, and the emergence of the Cold War, Marcuse strived to preserve the radical vision of his youth during a difficult historical period while many turned toward more conservative positions.Precisely the sort of broad theoretical and political theorizing that Marcuse undertook througout his life is needed today to analyze the momentous changes that we are currently undergoing.Excerpt: Personal history is interwoven with intellectual and political events in these papers. We debated whether letters belonged here: whether some should be published at all. My father had a deep sense of personal privacy, both as a character trait and as a political expression of resistance to the commodification of the private. Yet the letters contain substantive discussions also. We could have edited out, expurgated some of the material. While not publishing every letter my father wrote, our selection was based on interest, and every letter that is included is included in full. That decision was in part painful for me personally. The juxtaposition of the letters to Horkeimer and the exchange with Heidegger highlights the point. --from the Foreword by Peter Marcuse},

This issue addresses the historical not in an effort to effect a museumisation of new media art, but as a repository of challenges to the naturalised organisation of media, new and old, and the acceptance of them as forces of nature rather than human constructions.},

  abstract = {In this book, Laura Marks examines one of the world's most impressive, and affecting, bodies of independent and experimental cinema from the last twenty-five years: film and video works from the Arabic-speaking world. Some of these works' creative strategies are shared by filmmakers around the world; others arise from the particular economic, social, political, and historical circumstances of Arab countries, whose urgency, Marks argues, seems to demand experiment and invention. Grounded in a study of infrastructures for independent and experimental media art in the Arab world and a broad knowledge of hundreds of films and videos,  Hanan al-Cinema approaches these works thematically. Topics include the nomadism of the highway, nostalgia for '70s radicalism, a romance with the archive, algorithmic and glitch media, haptic and networked space, and cinema of the body. Marks develops an aesthetic of enfolding and unfolding to elucidate the different ways that cinema can make events perceptible, seek connections among them, and unfold in the bodies and thoughts of audiences. The phrase  Hanan al-cinema expresses the way movies sympathize with the world and the way audiences feel affection for, and are affected by, them. Marks's clear and expressive writing conveys these affections in works by such internationally recognized artists and filmmakers as Akram Zaatari, Elia Suleiman, Hassan Khan, Mounir Fatmi, and Joana Hadjithomas and Khalil Joreige, and others who should be better known.},

  abstract = {What is the role of art in everyday life? Art writing normally contrasts art with "everyday life." This book explores art as integral to the everyday life of modern society, providing materials to represent class and conflict, to explore sex and sexuality, and to think about modern industry and economic relationships. Art, as we know it, is not common to all forms of society but is peculiar to our own; what artischanges with people's conceptions of the tasks of art, conceptions that are themselves a part of social history. The history of society does not shape art from the outside, but includes the attempts of artists to find new ways of making art and thinking about it. The essays inArt in Its Timeoffer a critical examination of the central categories of art theory and history. They propose a mode of understanding grounded in concrete case studies of ideas and objects, exploring such topics as the gender content of eighteenth-century theories of the sublime and beautiful, the roleof photography in the production of aesthetic 'aura,' the limits of political art, and the paradox by which art, pursued for its own sake with no thought of commerical gain, can produce the highest-priced of all objects. Employing an unusually wide range of historical sources and theoretical perspectives to understand the place of art in capitalist society,Art in Its Timeshows a way out of many of the cul-de-sacs of recent art history and theory.},

  abstract = {Background: Few studies have comprehensively examined COVID-19 infection in children. Consequently, several important clinical questions remain unanswered.Methods: Epidemiological, demographic, laboratory, CT and clinical data of 76 children were collected retrospectively and analyzed with the FIsher-exact text and COX-regression statistical methods.Findings: Among 50 children with positive COVID-19 RT-PCR, five had negative initial RT-PCR results but showed positive results in subsequent tests. The incidence of pediatric infections was mainly clustered in families (40 [80\%]) and no child was identified as the first family member to be infected. The spectrum of COVID-19 severity in the cohort was: two (4\%) asymptomatic, five (10\%) very mild, 41 (82\%) mild, 0\% severe, and two (4\%) critically ill. The 26 children with exposure history and positive CT, but negative RT-PCR, all had similar CT findings with the RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 children. On laboratory assessment, 10 (20\%) patients had lymphopenia, four (8\%) lymphocytosis, eight (16\%) thrombocytosis, and nine (18\%) with elevated C-reactive protein. Seven of the 50 (14\%) had no findings on CT. Chest CT manifested with ground-glass opacity (GGO) as the most common pattern (29 [67\%] of 43) with a subpleural (41 [95\%] of 43) and lower lobe lung (28 [65\%] of 43) predominance. Among the 15 patients who received a CT scan within two days of discharge, ten had lesions that were not completely absorbed, two had lesions that were unchanged, two had additional lesions, and the remaining patient had no lesion during hospitalization.Interpretation: Positive CT with exposure history should also be used as criteria to admit children into the hospital for immediate treatment. The severity of COVID-19 infection in children is less than adults in terms of symptoms, lung consolidation as visualized by CT, and laboratory abnormalities. Children are also less likely to be infected. CT scan is not recommended to evaluate treatment response as indicated by COX-regression method.  Funding Statement: None.Declaration of Interests: All authors declare no competing interests.Ethics Approval Statement: This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Wuhan Children’s Hospital（Wuhan Maternal and Child Health Care Hospital \# WHCH 2020005). Written informed parental/guardian consent and child assent (where appropriate) were obtained prior to enrollment in the study.},

  abstract = {French philosophy since World War II has been preoccupied with the issue of difference. For some thinkers, especially Jean-Luc Nancy, Jacques Derrida, Emmanuel Levinas, and Gilles Deleuze, this preoccupation has led to a mode of philosophizing that privileges difference as a philosophical category.Reconsidering Difference has a twofold task, the primary one critical and the secondary one reconstructive. The critical task is to show that these various privilegings are philosophical failures. They wind up, for reasons unique to each position, endorsing positions that are either incoherent or implausible. Todd May considers the incoherencies of each position and offers an alternative approach. His reconstructive task, which he calls "contingent holism," takes the phenomena under investigationcommunity, language, ethics, and ontology - and sketches a way of reconceiving them that preserves the motivations of the rejected positions without falling into the problems that beset them.},

Patrick McCray shows how in this era, artists eagerly collaborated with engineers and scientists to explore new technologies and create visually and sonically compelling multimedia works. This art emerged from corporate laboratories, artists' studios, publishing houses, art galleries, and university campuses. Many of the biggest stars of the art world--Robert Rauschenberg, Yvonne Rainer, Andy Warhol, Carolee Schneemann, and John Cage--participated, but the technologists who contributed essential expertise and aesthetic input often went unrecognized.},

Each helicopter contains small LEDs and acts as a smart pixel. Through precisely controlled movements, the helicopters perform elaborate and synchronized motions and form an elastic display surface for any desired scenario. With the self-stabilizing and precise controlling technology from the ARES Lab, the motion of the pixels is adaptable in real time. The Flyfire canvas can transform itself from one shape to another or morph a two-dimensional photographic image into an articulated shape. The pixels are physically engaged in transitioning images from one state to another, which allows the Flyfire canvas to demonstrate a spatially animated viewing experience. Flyfire serves as an initial step to explore and imagine the possibilities of this free-form display: a swarm of pixels in a space. Flyfire, a project initiated by the SENSEable City Laboratory in collaboration with ARES Lab (Aerospace Robotics and Embedded Systems Laboratory) at MIT aims to transform any ordinary space into a highly immersive and interactive display environment.

  abstract = {Can Nietzsche be considered a thinker of media and mediation, as the German media theorist Friedrich Kittler declared in his influential book Gramophone, Film, Typewriter? Nietzsche was a truly transdisciplinary thinker, one who never fit into his own nineteenth-century surroundings and who recognized himself as a “herald and precursor” of the future, of our globally-reticulated digital present. Perhaps not since Kittler has there been a study — let alone an anthology — that re-assesses and re-evaluates Nietzsche’s thought in light of the technically mediated and machinic conditions of the human in the age of digital networks. Drawing on the first four years of conference-proceedings from the annual Nietzsche Workshop @ Western (NWW, Western University, Ontario), which culminated in the “New York NWW.IV”: Cyber-Nietzsche: Tunnels, Tightropes, Net-\&-Meshworks (held at the Center for Transformative Media, Parsons The New School for Design), The Digital Dionysus explores Nietzschean themes in light of the problems and questions of digitization, information and technical mediation, offering its readers the opportunity to consider Nietzsche’s contemporary relevance in light of emerging theories in new media studies, political studies, critical aesthetics, the digital humanities and contemporary post-continental philosophy. Co-edited by Dan Mellamphy and Nandita Biswas Mellamphy (Western University, UWO) for the CTM Documents Initiative imprint (Center for Transformative Media, Parsons School of Design, The New School), the volume features essays and works by leading and emerging philosophers, artists, [h]activists, and political media theorists, including Babette Babich, R.

  abstract = {By the early 1960s, theorists like Lévi-Strauss, Lacan, Foucault, and Barthes had created a world ruled by signifying structures and pictured through the grids of language, information, and systems. Artists soon followed, turning to language and its related forms to devise a new, conceptual approach to art making. Examining the ways in which artists shared the structuralist devotion to systems of many sorts, Systems We Have Loved shows that even as structuralism encouraged the advent of conceptual art, it also raised intractable problems that artists were forced to confront. Considering such notable art figures as Mary Kelly, Robert Morris, Robert Smithson, and Rosalind Krauss, Eve Meltzer argues that during this period the visual arts depicted and tested the far-reaching claims about subjectivity espoused by theorists. She offers a new way of framing two of the twentieth century’s most transformative movements—one artistic, one expansively theoretical—and she reveals their shared dream—or nightmare—of the world as a system of signs. By endorsing this view, Meltzer proposes, these artists drew attention to the fictions and limitations of this dream, even as they risked getting caught in the very systems they had adopted. The first book to describe art’s embrace of the world as an information system, Systems We Have Loved breathes new life into the study of conceptual art.},

It considers the history of media and communication studies, arguing that the academic discipline was a product of the analogue, broadcast-era, emerging in the early twentieth century as a response to the success of newspapers, radio and cinema and reflecting that era back in its organisation, themes and concepts.Digitalisation, however, takes us beyond this analogue era (media studies 1.0) into a new, post-broadcast era. Merrin argues that the digital-era demands an upgraded academic discipline: one reflecting the real media life of its students and teaching the key skills needed by the twenty-first century user. Media 2.0 demand a media studies 2.0 This original and critical overview of contemporary developments within media studies is ideal for general students of media and communication, as well as those specifically studying new and digital media.},

  abstract = {In  Knowledge Machines, Eric Meyer and Ralph Schroeder argue that digital technologies have fundamentally changed research practices in the sciences, social sciences, and humanities. Meyer and Schroeder show that digital tools and data, used collectively and in distributed mode -- which they term  e-research -- have transformed not just the consumption of knowledge but also the production of knowledge. Digital technologies for research are reshaping how knowledge advances in disciplines that range from physics to literary analysis. Meyer and Schroeder map the rise of digital research and offer case studies from many fields, including biomedicine, social science uses of the Web, astronomy, and large-scale textual analysis in the humanities. They consider such topics as the challenges of sharing research data and of big data approaches, disciplinary differences and new forms of interdisciplinary collaboration, the shifting boundaries between researchers and their publics, and the ways that digital tools promote openness in science.This book considers the transformations of research from a number of perspectives, drawing especially on the sociology of science and technology and social informatics. It shows that the use of digital tools and data is not just a technical issue; it affects research practices, collaboration models, publishing choices, and even the kinds of research and research questions scholars choose to pursue.  Knowledge Machines examines the nature and implications of these transformations for scholarly research.},

BeautifulSoup, 셀레니움, 테서랙트 등 강력한 파이썬 라이브러리 사용법과 함께 API, 인증, 이미지 및 텍스트 인식, 로그인 처리 등 웹 크롤링의 기초부터 고급 기법까지 종합적으로 다루는 유일한 책. 실제 업무와 생활에 적용할 수 있는 예제가 가득하다. 2판은 예제를 추가 및 업데이트했고 모던 웹에서 거의 모든 종류의 데이터를 가져오는 방법을 포괄적으로 다룬다.복잡 다양한 웹에서 우아하게 데이터를 수집하는 방법 A to Z~~~우리는 생활 속의 많은 부분이 인터넷에서 이루어지는 시대에 살고 있습니다. 그 어느 때보다 많은 데이터로 넘쳐나는 웹 세상에서 필요한 데이터를 가져와 분석하는 일의 중요성도 커졌습니다. 인터넷을 활보하며 데이터를 수집하는 프로그램을 웹 크롤러 혹은 웹 스크레이퍼라고 합니다. 웹 크롤러는 데이터 수집을 자동화하므로 비즈니스 의사 결정에 큰 도움이 되고, 웹사이트 스캐너로 활용할 수도 있어 보안 분야에서도 사용됩니다.~웹 크롤링은 인증 같은 웹 기술에 대한 이해는 물론, 데이터 정제, DB 저장 등 여러 기술에 대한 지식이 필요한 분야에 속합니다. 따라서 프로그래밍 스킬을 향상하는 데에 아주 좋은 주제이며, 과거에는 프로그래밍 전문가만이 웹 크롤러를 만들 수 있었습니다. 하지만 파이썬이라는 배우기 쉬운 언어와 쉽게 쓸 수 있는 각종 라이브러리들이 등장하며 이러한 장벽은 무너졌습니다. 기업 사례뿐만 아니라 음원 차트 추출하기, 서울의 기온 데이터 추출하기, 게시판 문서 다운로더 등 주위를 둘러보면 의외로 많은 생활 속 사례를 찾을 수 있습니다.~『파이썬으로 웹 크롤러 만들기(2판)』는 웹 크롤링이라는 주제 하나에 집중하는 책입니다. 업무상 웹 크롤러를 만들다 푹 빠진 나머지 회사를 나와서도 계속 웹 크롤러를 만들고 있는 개발자가 썼습니다. 파이썬과 라이브러리를 이용하여 아주 간단한 웹 크롤러를 만드는 것으로 시작해서, HTML, API 등 웹 기술의 기초부터 데이터 정제 및 저장, 자연어 처리, 이미지 및 텍스트 인식 등 고급 기법까지 종합적으로 살펴봅니다.~책의 1부는 파이썬과 함께 BeautifulSoup, 스크레이피 같은 라이브러리를 이용하여 아주 간단하게 웹 크롤러를 만들어보며 시작합니다. 나아가 API를 이용한 수집, 데이터를 MySQL로 저장하는 방법, CSV, PDF, 워드 파일을 분석하는 방법까지 필요에 따라 다양한 라이브러리를 활용하여 웹 크롤러를 구현하는 방법에 집중합니다. 위키백과를 크롤링하며 ‘케빈 베이컨의 여섯 다리’(과연 전 세계 사람은 여섯 다리만 거치면 연결될까요?) 문제를 풀어보는 예제도 있습니다.~2부는 웹 크롤링을 둘러싼 더욱 흥미로운 주제와 기법을 다룹니다. 웹에서 가져온 지저분한 데이터를 정돈하고 정제하는 방법(오픈리파인), 자연어 처리(NLTK), 폼과 로그인 뚫기(requests), 자바스크립트로 만든 동적 페이지 수집하기(셀레니움), 이미지 처리(필로) 및 텍스트 인식(테서랙트), 웹사이트 테스트(unittest), 원격 크롤링(토어) 등 고급 기법과 라이브러리 사용법을 살펴봅니다. 특히 텍스트 인식은 CAPTCHA, 즉 자동 가입 방지 문자를 우회하는 데 유용하며, 크롤링을 막는 방해물을 뚫기 위한 ‘사람처럼 보이기’ 기법은 아예 한 장을 할애해서 자세히 소개합니다.~오늘날 데이터가 넘쳐나는 웹에서 웹 크롤러로 할 수 있는 일은 무궁무진합니다. 필요한 것은 약간의 파이썬 프로그래밍 능력 하나뿐입니다. 나머지는 이 책에서 배울 수 있습니다. 웹 크롤링을 적용하여 업무를 자동화하고 생활 속에서 유용한 통찰을 찾는 데 이 책이 큰 도움이 되리라 믿습니다. 복잡 다양한 웹 세상에서 우아하게 데이터를 수집하고 싶은, ‘일상의 데이터 분석가’를 꿈꾸는 이들에게 이 책을 권합니다.~이 책은 많은 사랑을 받은 1판에 이어 출간된 원서 2판을 기반으로 합니다. 예제를 추가 및 업데이트했고 모던 웹에서 거의 모든 종류의 데이터를 가져오는 방법을 포괄적으로 다룹니다.[추천사]이 책에 나오는 예제와 도구를 이용해 여러 반복 업무를 자동화할 수 있었고, 그 시간을 더 흥미로운 일에 쓸 수 있었다. 결과를 바로 확인할 수 있고, 실제 업무나 생활에서 접하는 문제를 예제로 설명하여 빠르고 쉽게 읽을 수 있었다.\_ 에릭 반위크, 프랭클린 올린 공과대학교 컴퓨터 엔지니어~웹에서 데이터를 모으고 싶다는 생각을 한 번이라도 해봤다면 이 책을 읽어보길 권한다. 이미 크롤링을 해본 적이 있다면 더욱 도움이 될 것이다. 크롤링을 막는 페이지를 만난 적이 있다면? 이 책은 크롤러가 ‘인간’처럼 보이게 하는 법도 설명한다.\_ 클리프 추, Carousell 데이터 분석가},

After an evaluative review of a range of theories of information, this paper develops and defends a particular theory, one that sees information as both objective and veridical. By objective, we mean that the information carried by signs and messages exists independently of its receivers or observers. The information carried by a sign exists even if the sign is not actually observed. By veridical, we mean that information must be true or correct in order to be information –information is truth-constituted. False information is not information, but misinformation or disinformation. The paper develops this theory and then discusses four contentious issues – information as objective rather than subjective; information as true or correct; information and knowledge; and information and the ambiguity of meaning. It concludes with a discussion of the practical implications of the theory.},

  abstract = {Almost thirty years ago, W. J. T. Mitchell’s Iconology helped launch the interdisciplinary study of visual media, now a central feature of the humanities. Along with his subsequent Picture Theory and What Do Pictures Want?, Mitchell’s now-classic work introduced such ideas as the pictorial turn, the image/picture distinction, the metapicture, and the biopicture. These key concepts imply an approach to images as true objects of investigation—an “image science.”  Continuing with this influential line of thought, Image Science gathers Mitchell’s most recent essays on media aesthetics, visual culture, and artistic symbolism. The chapters delve into such topics as the physics and biology of images, digital photography and realism, architecture and new media, and the occupation of space in contemporary popular uprisings. The book looks both backward at the emergence of iconology as a field and forward toward what might be possible if image science can indeed approach pictures the same way that empirical sciences approach natural phenomena.  Essential for those involved with any aspect of visual media, Image Science is a brilliant call for a method of studying images that overcomes the “two-culture split” between the natural and human sciences.},

  abstract = {Genetic algorithms have been used in science and engineering as adaptive algorithms for solving practical problems and as computational models of natural evolutionary systems. This brief, accessible introduction describes some of the most interesting research in the field and also enables readers to implement and experiment with genetic algorithms on their own. It focuses in depth on a small set of important and interesting topics -- particularly in machine learning, scientific modeling, and artificial life -- and reviews a broad span of research, including the work of Mitchell and her colleagues.The descriptions of applications and modeling projects stretch beyond the strict boundaries of computer science to include dynamical systems theory, game theory, molecular biology, ecology, evolutionary biology, and population genetics, underscoring the exciting "general purpose" nature of genetic algorithms as search methods that can be employed across disciplines. An Introduction to Genetic Algorithms is accessible to students and researchers in any scientific discipline. It includes many thought and computer exercises that build on and reinforce the reader's understanding of the text. The first chapter introduces genetic algorithms and their terminology and describes two provocative applications in detail. The second and third chapters look at the use of genetic algorithms in machine learning (computer programs, data analysis and prediction, neural networks) and in scientific models (interactions among learning, evolution, and culture; sexual selection; ecosystems; evolutionary activity). Several approaches to the theory of genetic algorithms are discussed in depth in the fourth chapter. The fifth chapter takes up implementation, and the last chapter poses some currently unanswered questions and surveys prospects for the future of evolutionary computation.},

After a survey of some of the resistances encountered by visual studies in fields such as art history, aesthetics, and media studies, and a suggestion that visual studies is playing the role of ‘dangerous supplement’ to these fields, the essay turns to a discussion of some of the major received ideas that have seemed foundational to both negative and positive accounts of visual studies. These received ideas or myths include notions of the de-materialization of the image, and the erasure of boundaries between art and non-art, or visual and verbal media. They also include notions such as the very idea that there are such things as distinctly ‘visual media’. The political stakes of iconoclastic criticism (e.g. the overturning of ‘scopic regimes’) are also questioned, and an alternative (Nietzschean) strategy of ‘sounding the idols’ is proposed. The essay concludes with a description of pedagogical strategies in the teaching of visual culture, centered on an exercise the author calls ‘showing seeing’.},

  year = 2008,

  publisher = {MIT Press},
  abstract = {Artifacts (including works of architecture) play dual roles; they simultaneously perform functions and carry meaning. Columns support roofs, but while the sturdy Tuscan and Doric types traditionally signify masculinity, the slim and elegant Ionic and Corinthian kinds read as feminine. Words are often inscribed on objects. (On a door: "push" or "pull.") Today, information is digitally encoded (dematerialized) and displayed (rematerialized) to become part of many different objects, at one moment appearing on a laptop screen and at another, perhaps, on a building facade (as in Times Square). Well-designed artifacts succeed in being both useful and meaningful. In World's Greatest Architect, William Mitchell offers a series of snapshots—short essays and analyses—that examine the systems of function and meaning currently operating in our buildings, cities, and global networks.In his writing, Mitchell makes connections that aren't necessarily obvious but are always illuminating, moving in one essay from Bush-Cheney's abuse of language to Robert Venturi's argument against rigid ideology and in favor of graceful pragmatism. He traces the evolution of Las Vegas from Sin/Sign City to family-friendly resort and residential real estate boomtown. A purchase of chips leads not only to a complementary purchase of beer but to thoughts of Eames chairs (like Pringles) and Gehry (fun to imitate with tortilla chips in refried beans). As for who the world's greatest architect might be, here's a hint: he's also the oldest.},

  address = {New York},
  abstract = {Niklas Luhmann (1927-1998) was a German sociologist and system theorist who wrote on law, economics, politics, art, religion, ecology, mass media, and love. Luhmann advocated a radical constructivism and antihumanism, or "grand theory," to explain society within a universal theoretical framework. Nevertheless, despite being an iconoclast, Luhmann is viewed as a political conservative. Hans-Georg Moeller challenges this legacy, repositioning Luhmann as an explosive thinker critical of Western humanism.Moeller focuses on Luhmann's shift from philosophy to theory, which introduced new perspectives on the contemporary world. For centuries, the task of philosophy meant transforming contingency into necessity, in the sense that philosophy enabled an understanding of the necessity of everything that appeared contingent. Luhmann pursued the opposite―the transformation of necessity into contingency. Boldly breaking with the heritage of Western thought, Luhmann denied the central role of humans in social theory, particularly the possibility of autonomous agency. In this way, after Copernicus's cosmological, Darwin's biological, and Freud's psychological deconstructions of anthropocentrism, he added a sociological "fourth insult" to human vanity.A theoretical shift toward complex system-environment relations helped Luhmann "accidentally" solve one of Western philosophy's primary problems: mind-body dualism. By pulling communication into the mix, Luhmann rendered the Platonic dualist heritage obsolete. Moeller's clarity opens such formulations to general understanding and directly relates Luhmannian theory to contemporary social issues. He also captures for the first time a Luhmannian attitude toward society and life, defined through the cultivation of modesty, irony, and equanimity.},

  abstract = {This book explores the practice and transmission of Lacanian and Freudian theory. It discusses the pure versus applied analysis of Lacanian and Freudian theory in practice; and the hierarchical versus circular transmissions within psychoanalytic organizations.Underpinned by extensive practical knowledge of the clinic, this work examines the differences between Freud and Lacan in their understanding of the subject and the unconscious and pushes them in new directions. The book also offers an analysis and commentary of several key Lacanian texts including an accessible study of the notoriously challenging text L'etourdit. Offering both divergent and reinforcing takes on Lacan, the author explores the traits that separate out the psychoanalyst from other twentieth-century thinkers and theorists. This book offers a clear clinical picture of where Lacanian psychoanalysis is today, both in the US and internationally.},

  abstract = {Media screens—film, video, and computer screens—have increasingly pervaded both artistic production and everyday life since the 1960s. Yet the nature of viewing artworks made from these media, along with their subjective effects, remains largely unexplored. Screens addresses this gap, offering a historical and theoretical framework for understanding screen-reliant installation art and the spectatorship it evokes.~Examining a range of installations created over the past fifty years that investigate the rich terrain between the sculptural and the cinematic, including works by artists such as Eija-Liisa Ahtila, Doug Aitken, Peter Campus, Dan Graham, VALIE EXPORT, Bruce Nauman, and Michael Snow, Kate Mondloch traces the construction of screen spectatorship in art from the seminal film and video installations of the 1960s and 1970s to the new media artworks of today’s digital culture.~Mondloch identifies a momentous shift in contemporary art that challenges key premises of spectatorship brought about by technological objects that literally and metaphorically filter the subject’s field of vision. As a result she proposes that contemporary viewers are, quite literally, screen subjects and offers the unique critical leverage of art as an alternative way to understand media culture and contemporary visuality.},

As a consequence there are numerous definitions of emergence in the literature, but none well-suited to discussions of generative art.

In it, Nick Montfort reveals programming to be not merely a technical exercise within given constraints but a tool for sketching, brainstorming, and inquiring about important topics. He emphasizes programming's exploratory potential -- its facility to create new kinds of artworks and to probe data for new ideas. The book is designed to be read alongside the computer, allowing readers to program while making their way through the chapters. It offers practical exercises in writing and modifying code, beginning on a small scale and increasing in substance. In some cases, a specification is given for a program, but the core activities are a series of "free projects," intentionally underspecified exercises that leave room for readers to determine their own direction and write different sorts of programs. Throughout the book, Montfort also considers how computation and programming are culturally situated -- how programming relates to the methods and questions of the arts and humanities. The book uses Python and Processing, both of which are free software, as the primary programming languages.},

  abstract = {In the decades following World War II, American scientists were celebrated for their contributions to social and technological progress. They were also widely criticized for their increasingly close ties to military and governmental power--not only by outside activists but from among the ranks of scientists themselves. Disrupting Science tells the story of how scientists formed new protest organizations that democratized science and made its pursuit more transparent. The book explores how scientists weakened their own authority even as they invented new forms of political action.  Drawing extensively from archival sources and in-depth interviews, Kelly Moore examines the features of American science that made it an attractive target for protesters in the early cold war and Vietnam eras, including scientists' work in military research and activities perceived as environmentally harmful. She describes the intellectual traditions that protesters drew from--liberalism, moral individualism, and the New Left--and traces the rise and influence of scientist-led protest organizations such as Science for the People and the Union of Concerned Scientists. Moore shows how scientist protest activities disrupted basic assumptions about science and the ways scientific knowledge should be produced, and recast scientists' relationships to political and military institutions.  Disrupting Science reveals how the scientific community cumulatively worked to unbind its own scientific authority and change how science and scientists are perceived. In doing so, the book redefines our understanding of social movements and the power of insider-led protest.},

  abstract = {This article explores the observation that highly limiting, creative decisions of voluntary self-binding that radically prune the design solution space may in fact fuel and accelerate the process toward an innovative final design. To gain insight into this phenomenon, we propose the concept ‘decisive constraints’ based on a review of current, but dispersed, studies into creativity constraints. We build decisive constraints on two definitional conditions related to radical decision-making and creative turning points. To test our concept analytically and ensure its relevance to creative practice, we apply the two definitional conditions to three media facade installation projects in which our interaction design research lab has been involved. In accord with insights from these case analyses, we argue that decisive constraints may inform current research into design processes and act as a creative resource for practitioners, not only in interaction design but, we assume, also across related creative domains and disciplines.},

In fact knowledge obtained from social networks such as Twitter and Facebook has been shown to be extremely valuable to marketing research companies, public opinion organizations and other text mining entities. However, Web texts have been classified as noisy as they represent considerable problems both at the lexical and the syntactic levels. In this research we used a random sample of 3516 tweets to evaluate consumers’ sentiment towards well-known brands such as Nokia, T-Mobile, IBM, KLM and DHL. We used an expert-predefined lexicon including around 6800 seed adjectives with known orientation to conduct the analysis. Our results indicate a generally positive consumer sentiment towards several famous brands. By using both a qualitative and quantitative methodology to analyze brands’ tweets, this study adds breadth and depth to the debate over attitudes towards cosmopolitan brands.},

To this end, three procedures will be invoked to systematize a methodological trinity: a form of affirmative writing that implies a certain economy of words; a paradoxical way of writing that creates, and afterwards dilutes dichotomies; and a textuality that is experiential, that is, an aesthetic of existence. The purpose of this endeavor is to create new methodological procedures inspired by Flusser’s processes of writing-action and thought-movement.},

  abstract = {Political practice is still not adequately integrated into the geographical study of economic and social change - a point illustrated here by reference to the localities debate in which a central tension is evident between structural determination and contingency in socio-spatial relations. However, localities have recently been considered as constituted by networks of relations operating over various spatial scales. This approach requires attention to the ways in which actors in local situations are tied into wider sets of relations. A perspective derived from micro-sociology is introduced to facilitate the analysis of the links, or associations, between actors-in-situations, or actor-spaces. A case study illustrating how such an approach can make sense of political action at both 'national' and 'local' levels is examined. The study of an environmental conflict around minerals development shows that in practice the local and the national become 'mixed up' as actors build associations in pursuit of their goals. It is concluded that the practices of association between actor-spaces leave 'layers' of outcomes in places which contribute to patterns of regional development.},

Ahead of its time, it accurately predicted the rise of new genres of storytelling from the convergence of traditional media forms and computing. Taking the long view of artistic innovation over decades and even centuries, it remains forward-looking in its description of the development of new artistic traditions of practice, the growth of participatory audiences, and the realization of still-emerging technologies as consumer products. This updated edition of a book the New Yorker calls a “cult classic” offers a new introduction by Murray and chapter-by-chapter commentary relating Murray's predictions and enduring design insights to the most significant storytelling innovations of the past twenty years, from long-form television to artificial intelligence to virtual reality.Murray identifies the powerful new set of expressive affordances that computing offers for the ancient human activity of storytelling and considers what would be necessary for interactive narrative to become a mature and compelling art form. Her argument met with some resistance from print loyalists and postmodern hypertext enthusiasts, and it provoked a foundational debate in the emerging field of game studies on the relationship between narrative and videogames. But since Hamlet on the Holodeck's publication, a practice that was largely speculative has been validated by academia, artistic practice, and the marketplace.

  title = {Internet of Things and Automation of Imaging: Beyond Representationalism},
  author = {Nacher, Anna},
  volume = {5},
  pages = {22},
  abstract = {It is no doubt that the production of digital imagery invites for the major update of theoretical apparatus: what up until now was perceived solely or primarily as the stable representation of the world gives way to the image understood in terms of “the continuous actualization of networked data”[1] or “networked terminal”.[2] In my article I would like to argue that analysis of this new visual environment should not be limited to the procedures of data processing. What also invites serious investigation is acknowledging the reliance of contemporary media ecology on wireless communication which according to Adrian Mackenzie functions as “prepositions (‘at,’ ‘in,’ ‘with,’ by’, ‘between,’ ‘near,’ etc) in the grammar of contemporary media”.[3] It seems especially important in the case of the imagery accompanying some instances of internet of things, where the considerable part of networked imagery is produced in a fully automated and machinic way, as illustrated with my main example, Air Quality Egg.[4] This crowdsourced air pollution monitoring platform consists of networked sensors transmitting signals and data which are then visualized as graphs and maps through the IoT service provider, Xively. Such examples prompt the need for a major reconfiguration of the theory of digital image beyond the constraints of representationalism[5] and also beyond what has already been named “new aesthetic”.[6] In my opinion focusing not so much on the ontology of digital imagery as on its ontogenesis plays a key role in such undertaking. In other words, the main point of interest shifts from image’s being in the world to its becoming with and in the world. Hence I would like to propose the processual and relational concept of image as energy exchange, to some extent inspired the philosophy of Gilbert Simondon, yet with a strong posthumanist twist. Such metaphor allows for another step needed to transform how we think about production of digital imagery: shifting the focus from purely human intentionality to the machinic, hybrid and distributed agencies.

  abstract = {Our descendants will inevitably find their own name for what we now call, somewhat misleadingly, the Information Age. For the focus today is less on information itself than on the rapid profusion of devices for exchanging, storing and manipulating it. Multiple strands of technological development, some many decades old, have been coming together in ever more advanced incarnations, with complex results. The computer has a dense genealogy, going back to Joseph Marie Jacquard's punch-card loom (1804), Charles Babbage's Difference Engine (1833) and Herman Hollerith's census-data calculator (1890), before achieving a preliminary synthesis in the work of Alan Turing and John Von Neumann during World War II. Similarly, vacuum tubes gave way to transistors, which led to integrated circuits and, finally, to microchips. Satellites now draw on older technologies like television and the telephone to form another weave of relays and terminals for communication. These technologies affect almost every aspect of life, in ways that still appear radical, perhaps exhilarating, perhaps threatening. Nam June Paik, the electronic-multimedia artist, here suggests a cave painting for the present era: Samuel Morse's dots and dashes change into binary zeros and ones, satellites hover overhead and, down below, humanity remains, blissed out and plugged in.

  abstract = {This paper illustrates a sentiment analysis approach to extract sentiments associated with polarities of positive or negative for specific subjects from a document, instead of classifying the whole document into positive or negative.The essential issues in sentiment analysis are to identify how sentiments are expressed in texts and whether the expressions indicate positive (favorable) or negative (unfavorable) opinions toward the subject. In order to improve the accuracy of the sentiment analysis, it is important to properly identify the semantic relationships between the sentiment expressions and the subject. By applying semantic analysis with a syntactic parser and sentiment lexicon, our prototype system achieved high precision (75-95\%, depending on the data) in finding sentiments within Web pages and news articles.},

With its panoramic sweep and its gripping narrative flow, all the more remarkable for being written in prison where Nehru had no recourse to reference books or a library, Glimpses of World History covers the rise and fall of empires and civilizations from Greece and Rome to China and West Asia; great figures such as Ashoka and Genghis Khan, Gandhi and Lenin; wars and revolutions, democracies and dictatorships. An enduring classic, this book is dazzling testimony to the breadth of Nehru's world view, his grasp of the lessons of history, and of the forces and personalities that shape it" - publisher, 2004 reprint.},

They need to provide the capacity for intricate and idiosyncratic arrangements, total modifiability, undecided alternatives, and thorough internal documentation. I want to explain how some ideas developed and what they are. The original problem was to specify a computer system for personal information retrieval and documentation, able to do some rather complicated things in clear and simple ways. In this paper I will explain the original problem. Then I will explain why the problem is not simple, and why the solution (a file structure) must yet be very simple. The file structure suggested here is the Evolutionary List File, to be built of zippered lists. A number of uses will be suggested for such a file, to show the breadth of its potential usefulness. Finally, I want to explain the philosophical implications of this approach for information retrieval and data structure in a changing world.},

  author = {Nelson, Robert S. and Shiff, Richard},
  year = 2010,
  month = mar,
  publisher = {University of Chicago Press},
  abstract = {"Art" has always been contested terrain, whether the object in question is a medieval tapestry or Duchamp's Fountain. But questions about the categories of "art" and "art history" acquired increased urgency during the 1970s, when new developments in critical theory and other intellectual projects dramatically transformed the discipline. The first edition of Critical Terms for Art History both mapped and contributed to those transformations, offering a spirited reassessment of the field's methods and terminology.  Art history as a field has kept pace with debates over globalization and other social and political issues in recent years, making a second edition of this book not just timely, but crucial. Like its predecessor, this new edition consists of essays that cover a wide variety of "loaded" terms in the history of art, from sign to meaning, ritual to commodity. Each essay explains and comments on a single term, discussing the issues the term raises and putting the term into practice as an interpretive framework for a specific work of art. For example, Richard Shiff discusses "Originality" in Vija Celmins's To Fix the Image in Memory, a work made of eleven pairs of stones, each consisting of one "original" stone and one painted bronze replica.  In addition to the twenty-two original essays, this edition includes nine new ones—performance, style, memory/monument, body, beauty, ugliness, identity, visual culture/visual studies, and social history of art—as well as new introductory material. All help expand the book's scope while retaining its central goal of stimulating discussion of theoretical issues in art history and making that discussion accessible to both beginning students and senior scholars.

It refers to Newman’s essay "The Sublime is Now," in which he asks, "If we are living in a time without a legend that can be called sublime, how can we be creating sublime art?" His response is embodied in part by this painting—his largest ever at that time. Newman hoped that the viewer would stand close to this expansive work, and he likened the experience to a human encounter: "It's no different, really, from meeting another person. One has a reaction to the person physically. Also, there’s a metaphysical thing, and if a meeting of people is meaningful, it affects both their lives."},

  abstract = {Abstract Expressionism is often called action painting. But Barnett Newman was one of several Abstract Expressionists who eliminated the signs of the artist's hand. He preferred to work with broad, even expanses of color, as he does here in The Voice. The paint—egg tempera and enamel—is applied so evenly that the only hint of texture comes from the weave of the canvas itself. The broad expanse of white is interrupted only by an off–center stripe of slightly darker white. Similar stripes figure in most of Newman's paintings; he called them "zips." Scale is important in The Voice. If you stand a few feet from it, you'll find that it creates an engulfing environment, filling your field of vision almost entirely, as Newman intended. Like Kazimir Malevich and Piet Mondrian before him, Newman believed in the spiritual content of abstract art. Although his paintings appear to focus on issues of form, such as shape and color, he insisted that they had symbolic meanings—meanings which he hints at in his titles but never made explicit.},

Unlike previous approaches where the overall moods or sentiments are considered, the sentiments of the specific topics of the company are incorporated into the stock prediction model. Topics and related sentiments are automatically extracted from the texts in a message board by using our proposed method as well as existing topic models. In addition, this paper shows an evaluation of the effectiveness of the sentiment analysis in the stock prediction task via a large scale experiment. Comparing the accuracy average over 18 stocks in one year transaction, our method achieved 2.07\% better performance than the model using historical prices only. Furthermore, when comparing the methods only for the stocks that are difficult to predict, our method achieved 9.83\% better accuracy than historical price method, and 3.03\% better than human sentiment method.},

Dadaists ripped images of a mechanically reproduced world out of newspapers and magazines and reassembled them in their collages. Futurists instrumentalized the brevity of telegraph messages for their free word poetics. Artists such as F.T. Marinetti, Raoul Hausmann, and Luigi Russolo constantly abused existing media technologies and hijacked public communication. Niebisch traces how the early avant-garde movements started out as parasites inhabiting and irritating the emerging mass media circuits of the press, cinema, and wired and wireless communication and how they aimed at creating a media ecology based on and inspired by technologies such as the radio and the photo cell.},

It also demonstrates how photography as used in in the Norwegian racial research publications, although designed to highlight physical characteristics, also include references to cultural characteristics and context. Such inclusion of cultural markers and contextual information may be understood as a strategy to overcome the failure of the scientific community to isolate race as a biological fact. The photographs worked to secure “evidence” where evidence could not be found. This strategy is based on the abundancy, or excess of meaning, of the photographic image as such. The article argues that it is precisely this photographic excess that is the key to understanding why and how photography contributed to establish credibility to a scientific discipline in continuous struggle and with frequent breakdowns. The abundancy, or photographic excess, is also a key to understand how photographs that once were used as instruments of racial research, over time have undergone a series of transmutations of functions and meanings. Thus, racial photographs may acquire new meanings when circulating in time and space.}

Volume 2: Unfashionable Observations, translated by Richard T. Gray, was published in 1995. The edition is a new English translation, by various hands, of the celebrated Colli-Montinari edition, which has been acclaimed as one of the most important works of scholarship in the humanities in the last quarter century. The original Italian edition was simultaneously published in French, German, and Japanese.This volume of Human, All Too Human, the first of two parts, is the earliest of Nietzsche’s works in which his philosophical concerns and methodologies can be glimpsed. In this work Nietzsche began to establish the intellectual difference from his own cultural milieu and time that makes him our contemporary. Published in 1878, it marks both a stylistic and an intellectual shift away from Nietzsche’s own youthful affiliation with Romantic excesses of German thought and culture typified by Wagnerian opera.},

They mingle aphorisms drawn from notebooks of 1875-79, years when worsening health forced Nietzsche toward an increasingly solitary existence. Like its predecessor, Human, All Too Human II is above all an act of resistance not only to the intellectual influences that Nietzsche felt called upon to critique, but to the basic physical facts of his daily life. It turns an increasingly sharply formulated genealogical method of analysis toward Nietzsche's persistent concerns―metaphysics, morality, religion, art, style, society, politics and culture. The notebook entries included here offer a window into the intellectual sources behind Nietzsche's evolution as a philosopher, the reading and self-reflection that nourished his lines of thought. The linking of notebook entries to specific published aphorisms, included in the notes, allows readers of Nietzsche in English to trace for the first time the intensive process of revision through which he transformed raw notebook material into the finely crafted sequences of aphoristic reflection that signal his distinctiveness as a philosophical stylist.},

These include the death of God, the problem of nihilism, the role of truth, falsity and the will-to-truth in human life, the doctrine of the eternal recurrence, and the question of the proper attitude to adopt toward human suffering and toward human achievement.

In 1886 Nietzsche republished them together in a two-volume edition, with new prefaces to each volume. Both volumes are presented here in R. J. Hollingdale's distinguished translation (originally published in the series Cambridge Texts in German Philosophy) with a new introduction by Richard Schacht. In this wide-ranging work Nietzsche first employed his celebrated aphoristic style, so perfectly suited to his iconoclastic, penetrating and multi-faceted thought. Many themes of his later work make their initial appearance here, expressed with unforgettable liveliness and subtlety. Human, All Too Human well deserves its subtitle 'A Book for Free Spirits', and its original dedication to Voltaire, whose project of radical enlightenment here found a new champion.},

  abstract = {하버마스와 루만은 체계이론이 사회이론이냐 사회공학이냐는 주제를 놓고 이론논쟁을 벌였다. 현대사회에 대한 체계이론의 설명력이 가지는 과학적 타당성 문제를 두고 다툰 이 이론논쟁은 사회학은 물론 인문·사회과학 일반에서 유례없는 공명을 일으켰다. 이 논쟁에서 두 학자는 기존의 사회학과 달리 사회이론은 전체 사회를 연구 대상으로 하는 사회학연구를 주장했다. 사회학이 사회공학이어야 한다는 데 동의한 학자는 없었다. 이 논쟁으로부터 하버마스는 소통적 행위이론을 발전시켰고, 루만은 자기준거적 체계이론을 발전시켰다. 후기의 발전된 사회이론들에 견주어 두 학자의 초기 이론논쟁을 탐구하는 것은, 비서구사회의 학자인 우리들이 자기 사회를 관찰하고 기술하는 새로운 사회이론을 구축하는 데 자극을 받기 위함이다. 사회이론의 기본개념이 언어인지 의미인지? 사회이론의 대상이 합리성 문제인지 복잡성 증가 문제인지? 문제의 해결 방식이 담론인지 자기준거적 생산인지? 사회의 구조변동이 해방인지 진화인지? 이런 문제제기들은 사회이론에 대한 하버마스와 루만의 견해 차이를 규명하는 데 도움을 준다. 이 연구 작업의 이론적 함의는 비서구 사회에서 새로운 사회이론에 도전하는 데 있다.},

This was a time for the experimentation and innovation that produced today's industry of computer art and animation, along with new media for creative experiences with computers. The author has used digital computers in a variety of the visual arts, including still images, stereoscopic images, computer holography, three-dimensional animation, four-dimensional animation, interactive stereoscopic displays and input devices and, ultimately, three-dimensional force-feedback--the latter becoming a major component of today's virtual reality. This research and experimentation in computer art was performed during the 1960s. In this article the author reminisces and describes his early work.},

  abstract = {Three positions on the relation between sign and referent: idealism, realism, and constructivism. The study of signs (semiotics) shows that reality is always mediated, a situation radicalized by the digital revolution. It leads to the pressing question whether there is a reality outside the signs at all. There are three different philosophical positions. Idealism holds that signs construct our perception of reality, which subsequently is purely subjective. The subject constitutes reality like a projector in a cinema projects the objects on the screen. Idealism conceives this ‘screen’ as the world in its dimensions of space and time. The subject therefore not only projects reality, but it also perceives what it projects. Then there is nothing but signs, or to put it in the notorious words of Jacques Derrida: ‘there is nothing outside the text’ (Derrida, 1976, 158). There is no 'transcendent signified' (Derrida 1978, 278-280; Derrida, 1976, 20). In linguistic relativism (that some call a postmodern form of idealism) the subject does not have access to reality outside signification. An odd agent of a ‘post-modern idealism' is Lewis Carroll’s character Humpty Dumpty, who thinks that he can determine the meaning of his words without being limited by its ‘real’ reference.},

Put together by the curator-critic Paul O'Neill, Curating Subjects, documents the inter-dependent relationships between the curatorial past, present and speculative futures and, instead of following the convention of curators writing about themselves, invites the authors to provide a text about the curatorial work of others. The result is an eclectic volume of accessible responses that provides a pluralistic and dynamic curatorial discourse where critical essays, theoretical explorations, propositions, historical overviews, interviews, exhibition critiques and fictional accounts sit side by side. Essential reading for students and professionals alike.},

They were discussed, annotated, cited, collected, and translated—the three issues of Artforum in which they appeared have become nearly impossible to obtain. Having Brian O'Doherty's provocative essays available again is a signal event for the art world. This edition also includes "The Gallery as Gesture," a critically important piece published ten years after the others. O'Doherty was the first to explicitly confront a particular crisis in postwar art as he sought to examine the assumptions on which the modern commercial and museum gallery was based. Concerned with the complex and sophisticated relationship between economics, social context, and aesthetics as represented in the contested space of the art gallery, he raises the question of how artists must construe their work in relation to the gallery space and system. These essays are essential reading for anyone interested in the history and issues of postwar art in Europe and the United States. Teeming with ideas, relentless in their pursuit of contradiction and paradox, they exhibit both the understanding of the artist (Patrick Ireland) and the precision of the scholar. With an introduction by Thomas McEvilley and a brilliantly cogent afterword by its author, Brian O'Doherty once again leads us on the perilous journey to center to the art world: Inside the White Cube.},

Our understanding of the Web has not kept pace with its development. It is engineered using formally specified languages and protocols, but has large scale effects on society. Certain human activities – including education – have been altered irretrievably. This article argues for the development of the discipline of Web Science, to understand the reciprocal relationship between the Web and society at a number of scales, from technical protocols to emergent social behaviour, to ensure that the Web’s growth will continue, and will benefit society. The need for both analysis and engineering demands an inherently interdisciplinary approach. With this in mind, a new Web Science Research Initiative is briefly described.},

  abstract = {From Guy Debord in the early 1950s to Richard Long, Janet Cardiff, and Esther Polak more recently, contemporary artists have returned again and again to the walking motif. Today, the convergence of global networks, online databases, and new tools for mobile mapping coincides with a resurgence of interest in walking as an art form. In  Walking and Mapping, Karen O'Rourke explores a series of walking/mapping projects by contemporary artists. She offers close readings of these projects -- many of which she was able to experience firsthand -- and situates them in relation to landmark works from the past half-century. Together, they form a new entity, a dynamic whole greater than the sum of its parts. By alternating close study of selected projects with a broader view of their place in a bigger picture, Walking and Mapping itself maps a complex phenomenon.},

Part of the fascination stems from the fact that little of what they wrote survives. Here Osborne invites her readers to dip their toes into the fragmentary remains of thinkers from Thales to Pythagoras, Heraclitus to Protagoras, and to try to reconstruct the moves that they were making, to support stories that Western philosophers and historians of philosophy like to tell about their past. This book covers the invention of western philosophy: introducing to us the first thinkers to explore ideas about the nature of reality, time, and the origin of the universe.About the Series: Combining authority with wit, accessibility, and style, Very Short Introductions offer an introduction to some of life's most interesting topics. Written by experts for the newcomer, they demonstrate the finest contemporary thinking about the central problems and issues in hundreds of key topics, from philosophy to Freud, quantum theory to Islam.},

  abstract = {Walter Benjamin's importance as a philosopher and criticaltheorist can be gauged by the diversity of his intellectual influenceand the continuing productivity of his thought. Primarily regarded as aliterary critic and essayist, the philosophical basis ofBenjamin's writings is increasingly acknowledged. They were adecisive influence upon Theodor W. Adorno's conception ofphilosophy's actuality or adequacy to the present (Adorno 1931).In the 1930s, Benjamin's efforts to develop a politicallyoriented, materialist aesthetic theory proved an important stimulusfor both the Frankfurt School of Critical Theory and the Marxist poetand dramatist Bertolt Brecht.~ , The delayed appearance of Benjamin's collected writings has determinedand sustained the Anglophone reception of his work. (A two-volumeselection was published in German in 1955, with a full edition notappearing until 1972–89; English anthologies first appeared in1968 and 1978; the four-volume Selected Writings,1996–2003.) Originally received in the context of literarytheory and aesthetics, the philosophical depth and cultural breadth ofBenjamin's thought have only recently begun to be fullyappreciated. Despite the voluminous size of the secondary literaturethat it has produced, his work remains a continuing source ofproductivity. An understanding of the intellectual context of his workhas contributed to the philosophical revival of Early GermanRomanticism. His essay on ‘The Work of Art in the Age of ItsTechnical Reproducibility’ remains a major theoretical text forfilm theory. One-Way Street and the work arising from hisunfinished research on nineteenth century Paris (The ArcadesProject), provide a theoretical stimulus for cultural theory andphilosophical concepts of the modern. Benjamin's messianicunderstanding of history has been an enduring source of theoreticalfascination and frustration for a diverse range of philosophicalthinkers, including Jacques Derrida, Giorgio Agamben and, in acritical context, Jürgen Habermas. The ‘Critique ofViolence’ and ‘On the Concept of History’ areimportant sources for Derrida's discussion of messianicity, which hasbeen influential, along with Paul de Man's discussion of allegory, forthe poststructuralist reception of Benjamin's writings. Aspects ofBenjamin's thought have also been associated with a revival ofpolitical theology, although it is doubtful this reception is true tothe tendencies of Benjamin's own political thought. More recently,interest in Benjamin’s philosophy of education has been fueled by thetranslations of his Early Writings in 2011 and thetranscripts of his radio broadcasts for children (RadioBenjamin) in 2014.},

Oursler experimented with video, smoke machines, a variety of soundtracks, and several sculptural elements to explore the historical and current impact technologies have on our daily lives. The Influence Machine was comprised of projections of large faces onto smoke and trees with corresponding narratives--poetic texts written by Oursler for this project and other voices from the history of early technology. Images of knocking hands were also projected onto trees and surrounding buildings with corresponding knocking sounds that alluded to Morse code and other early forms of communication. Texts ran over construction fencing and trees pronouncing intimate and encoded messages. In addition to Oursler's abstract narratives, the soundtrack for The Influence Machine included segments of radio feedback, the unusual sounds of a glass harmonica performed by Dean Shostak, and a score by Tony Conrad commissioned for this project.},

These interfaces support smartphones, wearables, in-vehicle, robotic, and many other applications that are now highly competitive commercially.   This edited collection is written by international experts and pioneers in the field. It provides a textbook for students, and a reference and technology roadmap for professionals working in this rapidly emerging area.   Volume 1 of the handbook presents relevant theory and neuroscience foundations for guiding the development of high-performance systems. Additional chapters discuss approaches to user modeling, interface design that supports user choice, synergistic combination of modalities with sensors, and blending of multimodal input and output. They also highlight an in-depth look at the most common multimodal-multisensor combinations- for example, touch and pen input, haptic and non-speech audio output, and speech co-processed with visible lip movements, gaze, gestures, or pen input. A common theme throughout is support for mobility and individual differences among users-including the world's rapidly growing population of seniors.   These handbook chapters provide walk-through examples and video illustrations of different system designs and their interactive use. Common terms are defined, and information on practical resources is provided (e.g., software tools, data resources) for hands-on project work to develop and evaluate multimodal-multisensor systems. In the final chapter, experts exchange views on a timely and controversial challenge topic, and how they believe multimodal-multisensor interfaces should be designed in the future to most effectively advance human performance.},

  abstract = {This book uncovers an underlying dispute over the role images play in contemporary society and, consequently, over their values and purposes. Two decades after the concepts of the pictorial and the iconic turn changed our vernacular involvement with regard to images, it has become clear that it was not only a newly discovered social, political or sexual construction of the visual field that brought turbulence into disciplinary knowledge, but that images have their own "pictorial logic" with powers exceeding those that are purely iconic or visually discernible. Instead of underscoring previously defined concepts of the picture, the contributors to this book view visual studies and Bildwissenschaft "merely" as a place for the theory of images, making a case for the hotly-debated topic of their powers and weaknesses on the one hand, and of their respective theories on the other. Therefore, as the title indicates, this book theorizes images, but it does not present a theory of images, because visual studies cannot lead to a unified theory of images unless a unified ontology of images can be agreed upon first. Although that would be a different task altogether, all the contributions in this book (in different ways and at different paces), by theorizing images in their aesthetic, historical, media and technological guises, pave the way for the future of visual culture and for the image science that will make this future more comprehensible.},

Polarity of tweets is evaluated by using three sentiment lexicons—SenticNet, SentiWordNet and SentislangNet. SentislangNet is a sentiment lexicon built from SenticNet and SentiWordNet for slangs and acronyms. Experimental results show fairly good FFF-score. The method is implemented and tested in parallel python framework and is shown to scale well with large volume of data on multiple cores.},

Finally available in English, it is an unrivaled example of Panofsky's early method that placed him within broader developments in theories of knowledge and cultural change. Here, drawing on a massive body of learning that ranges over Antique philosophy, theology, science, and optics as well as the history of art, Panofsky produces a type of "archaeology" of Western representation that far surpasses the usual scope of art historical studies.Perspective in Panofsky's hands becomes a central component of a Western "will to form," the expression of a schema linking the social, cognitive, psychological, and especially technical practices of a given culture into harmonious and integrated wholes. Yet the perceptual schema of each historical culture or epoch is different, and each gives rise to a different but equally full vision of the world. Panofsky articulates these different spatial systems, demonstrating their particular coherence and compatibility with the modes of knowledge, belief, and exchange that characterized the cultures in which they arose. Our own modernity, Panofsky shows, is characterized by its peculiarly mathematical expression of the concept of the infinite, within a space that is necessarily both continuous and homogeneous.},

  abstract = {Background In the mid to late 1980s, the middle class in Korea rapidly grew based on the economic boom, and started to build a new everyday culture by designating apartment complexes as a place for living. 「A House Worth Seeing」, a fixed column for the women's magazine 『Saemigipunmul』, covered the housing spaces of the upper segment of the middle class and introduced their taste and design sense. The articles and photos in these columns have an important meaning as design archives selected and accumulated according to editorial direction. Methods This study examines the internal dynamics and logic of the arrangement of objects in social and cultural contexts surrounding apartments, by taking a closer look at the living rooms introduced in 「A House Worth Seeing」. 'The frame of the living room' created by the organization of interior space is used as the main analysis tool. Results Various types of object arrangement strategies emerged around apartments. Based on the examples introduced in 「A House Worth Seeing」, three strategies can be distinguished: museumization, gallerization, and theatricalization. The frame of the living room was a field of vision in which apartment dwellers gazed at their interior spaces, and at the same time a coordinate system of object arrangement which they must consider in order to fomulate their own organizational strategy. Conclusions Apartment dwellers appearing in 「A House Worth Seeing」 shared similar aspects to "the arranging man" defined by Jean Baudrillard in 『The System of Objects』. They not only consumed their own objects, but also created an interior atmosphere in a particular direction, by placing, arranging and controlling objects. The framework of the living room played an important role in establishing them as a new subject form of consumer capitalism.},

Not only have traditional forms of art such as printing, painting, photography, and sculpture been transformed by digital techniques and media, but the emergence of entirely new forms such as internet and software art, digital installation, and virtual reality has forever changed the way we define art.  Christiane Paul surveys the developments in digital art from its appearance in the 1980s to the present day and looks ahead to what the future may hold. She discusses the key artists and works in the genre, drawing a distinction between work that uses digital practices as tools to produce traditional forms and work that uses them to create new kinds of art. She explores the broader themes and questions raised by these artworks such as viewer interaction, artificial life and intelligence, political and social activism, networks and telepresence, and issues surrounding the collection, presentation, and preservation of digital art.  This third, expanded edition of the popular resource investigates key areas of digital art practice that have gained prominence in recent years, including interactive public installation, augmented and mixed reality, social networking, and file-sharing technologies.},

While they generate high-quality texts, excel at stylistic reproduction, and tap into an immense pool of information, they can produce wildly inaccurate responses. The hype around LLMs led to them being characterized as “reasoning”, “sentient”, or “knowing” like humans. We examine these characterizations and discuss what LLMs can’t do and what they are surprisingly good at. LLMs are still susceptible to traditional issues with AI, probabilities are not knowledge, and they are not in the world. Nonetheless, LLMs, despite not being human, have great potential to perform various creative tasks. We conclude that LLMs are beyond “mere generation” and perceivable as creative, but we may need to reassess some frameworks for creativity evaluation.},

Writing in The New Republic, Mr. Dewey said, "Nothing much will happen in philosophy as long as a main object among philosophers is defense of some formulated historical position. I do not know of any other thinker more calculated than Peirce to give emancipation from the intellectual fortifications of the past and to arouse a fresh imagination."Originally published as six separate volumes, the Peirce papers appear in the new Belknap Press edition in three handsome books of two volumes each. The content is identical with that of the original edition: Volume I, Principles of Philosophy; Volume II, Elements of Logic; Volume III, Exact Logic; Volume IV, The Simplest Mathematics; Volume V, Pragmatism and Pragmaticism; Volume VI, Scientific Metaphysics.This republication presents the seminal concepts of a writer described in John Dewey's article as "the most original philosophical mind this country has produced."},

  abstract = {In this paper I argue that when we try to describe the specifically self-aware part of the mind, as opposed to the host of unconscious psychic activities, we face a potentially fatal difficulty - one I have termed ‘the inconceivability problem’. Because of the entanglement of the subject and the object in observations of subjectivity, and certain conceptual circularities, it seems we might never be able to represent the self-conscious mind with anything other than itself. This could leave consciousness studies in a very awkward position. In an attempt to address this I propose that the concept of infinite regression, which is normally associated with the ‘homuncular fallacy’, be reinterpreted productively, in a way that puts self-reference at the heart of our conception of phenomenal experience. Looking at several examples of self-referential systems and theories of mind, including Zen, it seems one system in particular - video feedback - offers a rich source of analogies that might help us to visualize, if not explain, the operation of ‘world-embedded’ self-consciousness. I explain that this inquiry is an attempt to build a theoretical foundation for the construction of a ‘conscious art’, by which I mean a type of art that is, to some extent, aware of itself and its surroundings.},

  abstract = {In a lab at MIT, scientists have created an artificial being named COG. To watch COG interact with its environment--to recognize that this machine has actual body language--is to experience a hair-raising, gut-level reaction. Because just as we connect to artificial people in fiction, the merest hint of human-like action or appearance invariably engages us in real life. "Digital People examines the ways in which technology is inexorably driving us to a new and different level of humanity. As scientists draw on nanotechnology, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and new kinds of materials, they are learning how to create beings that move, think, and look like people. Other researchers are routinely using sophisticated surgical techniques to implant computer chips and drug-dispensing devices into our bodies, designing fully functional man-made body parts, and linking human brains with computers to make people healthier, smarter, and stronger. In short, we are going beyond what was once only science fiction to create bionic people with fully integrated artificial components--and it will not be long before we reach the ultimate goal of constructing a completely synthetic human-like being. It seems quintessentially human to look beyond our natural limitations. Science has long been the lens through which we peer to discern our future. Although we are rightfully fearful about manipulating the boundaries between animate and inanimate, the benefits are too great to ignore. This thoughtful and provocative book shows us just where technology is taking us, in directions both wonderful and terrible, to ponder what it means to be human.},

  abstract = {According to Rosalind Picard, if we want computers to be genuinely intelligent and to interact naturally with us, we must give computers the ability to recognize, understand, even to have and express emotions. The latest scientific findings indicate that emotions play an essential role in decision making, perception, learning, and more -- that is, they influence the very mechanisms of rational thinking. Not only too much, but too little emotion can impair decision making. According to Rosalind Picard, if we want computers to be genuinely intelligent and to interact naturally with us, we must give computers the ability to recognize, understand, even to have and express emotions. Part 1 of this book provides the intellectual framework for affective computing. It includes background on human emotions, requirements for emotionally intelligent computers, applications of affective computing, and moral and social questions raised by the technology. Part 2 discusses the design and construction of affective computers. Although this material is more technical than that in Part 1, the author has kept it less technical than typical scientific publications in order to make it accessible to newcomers. Topics in Part 2 include signal-based representations of emotions, human affect recognition as a pattern recognition and learning problem, recent and ongoing efforts to build models of emotion for synthesizing emotions in computers, and the new application area of affective wearable computers.},

Nietzsche uses a mixture of homilies, parables, epigrams and dreams to introduce some of his most striking doctrines, including the Overman, nihilism, and the eternal return of the same. This edition offers a new translation by Adrian Del Caro which restores the original versification of Nietzsche's text and captures its poetic brilliance. Robert Pippin's introduction discusses many of the most important interpretative issues raised by the work, including who is Zarathustra and what kind of 'hero' is he and what is the philosophical significance of the work's literary form? The volume will appeal to all readers interested in one of the most original and inventive works of modern philosophy.},

  abstract = {Some dialogues of Plato are of so various a character that their relation to the other dialogues cannot be determined with any degree of certainty. The Theaetetus, like the Parmenides, has points of similarity both with his earlier and his later writings. The perfection of style, the humour, the dramatic interest, the complexity of structure, the fertility of illustration, the shifting of the points of view, are characteristic of his best period of authorship. The vain search, the negative conclusion, the figure of the midwives, the constant profession of ignorance on the part of Socrates, also bear the stamp of the early dialogues, in which the original Socrates is not yet Platonized. Had we no other indications, we should be disposed to range the Theaetetus with the Apology and the Phaedrus, and perhaps even with the Protagoras and the Laches. But when we pass from the style to an examination of the subject, we trace a connection with the later rather than with the earlier dialogues.},

  abstract = {"This is teaching at its best!"--Hans Camenzind, inventor of the 555 timer (the world's most successful integrated circuit), and author of Much Ado About Almost Nothing: Man's Encounter with the Electron (Booklocker.com)"A fabulous book: well written, well paced, fun, and informative. I also love the sense of humor. It's very good at disarming the fear. And it's gorgeous. I'll be recommending this book highly."--Tom Igoe, author of Physical Computing and Making Things TalkA "magnificent and rewarding book. ... Every step of this structured instruction is expertly illustrated with photos and crisp diagrams. . . . This really is the best way to learn."--Kevin Kelly, in Cool ToolsThe first edition of Make: Electronics established a new benchmark for introductory texts. This second edition enhances that learning experience.Here you will find unique, photographically precise diagrams of breadboarded components, to help you build circuits with speed and precision. A new shopping guide and a simplified range of components, will minimize your investment in parts for the projects. A completely new section on the Arduino shows you how to write properly structured programs instead of just downloading other people's code. Projects have been reworked to provide additional features, and the book has been restructured to offer a step-by-step learning process that is as clear and visually pleasing on handheld devices as it is on paper. Full color is used throughout.As before, Make: Electronics begins with the basics. You'll see for yourself how components work--and what happens when they don't. You'll short out a battery and overheat an LED. You'll also open up a potentiometer and a relay to see what's inside. No other book gives you such an opportunity to learn from real-life experiences.Ultimately, you will build gadgets that have lasting value, and you'll have a complete understanding of how they work. From capacitors to transistors to microcontrollers--it's all here.Hans Camenzind, inventor of the 555 Timer (the world's most successful integrated circuit chip), said that "This is teaching at its best!" when he reviewed the first edition. Now the second edition offers even more!},

It demonstrates that the complexity of modern systems is an existential challenge for our ability to understand and research these issues. A new theory is proposed for studying complexity, explaining how system interactionism differs from established ideas, including assemblage and actor network theories. After considering the social system of Niklas Luhmann, the author proposes an interactionist methodology better equipped to deal with system complexity. A description of the logical operations of the digital and political systems is provided, establishing precedents for an analysis of the role of hypertext in shaping the emergent digital-politics. The book demonstrates how the principles of system interactionism can guide digital media research into polarisation and political language},

In order to have a positive impact, they must go beyond conventional approaches to uncover real needs, make insightful connections, and develop effective solutions. Information Design Unbound provides a clear, engaging introduction to the field, and prepares students to be strategic thinkers and visual problem solvers who can confidently make sense in a changing world. Sheila Pontis and Michael Babwahsingh present a holistic view of information design, synthesizing decades of research, cross-disciplinary knowledge, and emerging practices. The book opens by laying a foundation in the field, first painting the bigger picture of what it is and how it originated, before explaining the scientific and cultural dimensions of how people perceive and understand visual information. Transitioning from context to practice, a discussion of the various roles information designers play and how they work sets the stage for the information design process. Chapters then delve into each step of the process, from problem definition to design and evaluation. The final section of the book puts everything together, with detailed project walk-throughs in areas such as icon design, visual explanations, wayfinding, websites and apps. Written and designed with students' needs in mind, this book brings information design fundamentals to life: exercises allow students to put lessons directly into practice, case studies demonstrate how information designers think and work, and generous illustrations clarify concepts in a visually engaging way. Information Design Unbound helps beginning designers build the mindset and skillset to navigate visual communication challenges wherever they may arise"--},

  abstract = {In  From Technological to Virtual Art, respected historian of art and technology Frank Popper traces the development of immersive, interactive new media art from its historical antecedents through today's digital, multimedia, and networked art. Popper shows that contemporary virtual art is a further refinement of the technological art of the late twentieth century and also a departure from it. What is new about this new media art, he argues, is its humanization of technology, its emphasis on interactivity, its philosophical investigation of the real and the virtual, and its multisensory nature. He argues further that what distinguishes the artists who practice virtual art from traditional artists is their combined commitment to aesthetics and technology. Their "extra-artistic" goals -- linked to their aesthetic intentions -- concern not only science and society but also basic human needs and drives.Defining virtual art broadly as art that allows us, through an interface with technology, to immerse ourselves in the image and interact with it, Popper identifies an aesthetic-technological logic of creation that allows artistic expression through integration with technology. After describing artistic forerunners of virtual art from 1918 to 1983 -- including art that used light, movement, and electronics -- Popper looks at contemporary new media forms and artists. He surveys works that are digital based but materialized, multimedia offline works, interactive digital installations, and multimedia online works (net art) by many artists, among them John Maeda, Jenny Holzer, Brenda Laurel, Agnes Hegedus, Stelarc, and Igor Stromajer. The biographical details included reinforce Popper's idea that technology is humanized by art. Virtual art, he argues, offers a new model for thinking about humanist values in a technological age.},

Aspect extraction is a subtask of sentiment analysis that consists in identifying opinion targets in opinionated text, i.e., in detecting the specific aspects of a product or service the opinion holder is either praising or complaining about. We used a 7-layer deep convolutional neural network to tag each word in opinionated sentences as either aspect or non-aspect word. We also developed a set of linguistic patterns for the same purpose and combined them with the neural network. The resulting ensemble classifier, coupled with a word-embedding model for sentiment analysis, allowed our approach to obtain significantly better accuracy than state-of-the-art methods.},

In the coming decades, coping with such information and mining useful knowledge from it will be an increasingly difficult task. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for multimodal sentiment analysis, which consists in harvesting sentiments from Web videos by demonstrating a model that uses audio, visual and textual modalities as sources of information. We used both feature- and decision-level fusion methods to merge affective information extracted from multiple modalities. A thorough comparison with existing works in this area is carried out throughout the paper, which demonstrates the novelty of our approach. Preliminary comparative experiments with the YouTube dataset show that the proposed multimodal system achieves an accuracy of nearly 80\%, outperforming all state-of-the-art systems by more than 20\%.},

  abstract = {Information visualization has often focused on providing deep insight for expert user populations and on techniques for amplifying cognition through complicated interactive visual models. This paper proposes a new subdomain for infovis research that complements the focus on analytic tasks and expert use. Instead of work-related and analytically driven infovis, we propose casual information visualization (or casual infovis) as a complement to more traditional infovis domains. Traditional infovis systems, techniques, and methods do not easily lend themselves to the broad range of user populations, from expert to novices, or from work tasks to more everyday situations. We propose definitions, perspectives, and research directions for further investigations of this emerging subfield. These perspectives build from ambient information visualization (Skog et al., 2003), social visualization, and also from artistic work that visualizes information (Viegas and Wattenberg, 2007). We seek to provide a perspective on infovis that integrates these research agendas under a coherent vocabulary and framework for design. We enumerate the following contributions. First, we demonstrate how blurry the boundary of infovis is by examining systems that exhibit many of the putative properties of infovis systems, but perhaps would not be considered so. Second, we explore the notion of insight and how, instead of a monolithic definition of insight, there may be multiple types, each with particular characteristics. Third, we discuss design challenges for systems intended for casual audiences. Finally we conclude with challenges for system evaluation in this emerging subfield.},

  abstract = {Researchers have explored the design of ambient information systems across a wide range of physical and screen-based media. This work has yielded rich examples of design approaches to the problem of presenting information about a user's world in a way that is not distracting, but is aesthetically pleasing, and tangible to varying degrees. Despite these successes, accumulating theoretical and craft knowledge has been stymied by the lack of a unified vocabulary to describe these systems and a consequent lack of a framework for understanding their design attributes. We argue that this area would significantly benefit from consensus about the design space of ambient information systems and the design attributes that define and distinguish existing approaches. We present a definition of ambient information systems and a taxonomy across four design dimensions: Information Capacity, Notification Level, Representational Fidelity, and Aesthetic Emphasis. Our analysis has uncovered four patterns of system design and points to unexplored regions of the design space, which may motivate future work in the field.},

In Experiment 1, scientific theories described as poor explanations decreased automatic evaluations of science, but simultaneously increased automatic evaluations of God. In Experiment 2, using God as an explanation increased automatic evaluations of God, but decreased automatic evaluations of science. Religion and science both have the potential to be ultimate explanations, and these findings suggest that this competition for explanatory space can create an automatic opposition in evaluations.},

Along the way, the basics of formal logic are explained in simple, non-technical terms, showing that logic is a powerful and exciting part of modern philosophy.About the Series: Combining authority with wit, accessibility, and style, Very Short Introductions offer an introduction to some of life's most interesting topics. Written by experts for the newcomer, they demonstrate the finest contemporary thinking about the central problems and issues in hundreds of key topics, from philosophy to Freud, quantum theory to Islam.},

  abstract = {This paper outlines an Import Theory of subjectivity and selfhood. Import theory claims that subjectivity is initially perceived as a key feature of other minds before it then becomes imported from other minds to own minds whereby it lays the ground for mental selfhood. Import theory builds on perception-production matching, which in turn draws on both representational mechanisms and social practices. Representational mechanisms rely on common coding of perception and production. Social practices rely on action mirroring in dyadic interactions. The interplay between mechanisms and practices gives rise to model self on others. Individuals become intentional agents in virtue of perceiving others mirroring themselves. The outline of the theory is preceded by an introductory section that locates import theory in the broader context of competing approaches, and it is followed by a concluding section that assesses import theory in terms of empirical evidence and explanatory power.},

  abstract = {What are mirror systems good for? Several suggestions have been made in response to this question, addressing the putative functions of mirror systems in minds and brains. This paper examines possible contributions of mirror systems to the emergence of subjectivity. At the heart of the discussion is the notion of social mirroring, which has a long tradition in social philosophy and social anthropology. Taking the existence of mirror devices in minds and brains for granted, I argue that social mirroring is a prerequisite for the constitution of mental selves, and, hence, the emergence of subjectivity. However, the fact that self and subjectivity are socially created should not be taken to indicate that they are illusory. They are as real as natural facts are.},

  abstract = {"Productive forces", "productive powers" or "forces of production" (in German, Produktivkräfte), is a central idea in Marxism and historical materialism. In Karl Marx and Frederick Engels's own critique of political economy, it refers to the combination of the means of labor (tools, machinery, land, infrastructure and so on) with human labour power. Marx and Engels probably derived the concept from Adam Smith's reference to the "productive powers of labour" (see e.g. chapter 8 of The Wealth of Nations), although the German political economist Friedrich List also mentions the concept of "productive powers" in The National System of Political Economy (1841). All those forces which are applied by people in the production process (body and brain, tools and techniques, materials, resources, quality of workers' cooperation and equipment) are encompassed by this concept, including those management and engineering functions technically indispensable for production (as contrasted with social control functions). Human knowledge can also be a productive force. Together with the social and technical relations of production, the productive forces constitute a historically specific mode of production.},

  abstract = {Translated by Steven Corcoran Only yesterday aesthetics stood accused of concealing cultural games of social distinction. Now it is considered a parasitic discourse from which artistic practices must be freed. But aesthetics is not a discourse. It is an historical regime of the identification of art. This regime is paradoxical, because it founds the autonomy of art only at the price of suppressing the boundaries separating its practices and its objects from those of everyday life and of making free aesthetic play into the promise of a new revolution. Aesthetics is not a politics by accident but in essence. But this politics operates in the unresolved tension between two opposed forms of politics: the first consists in transforming art into forms of collective life, the second in preserving from all forms of militant or commercial compromise the autonomy that makes it a promise of emancipation. This constitutive tension sheds light on the paradoxes and transformations of critical art. It also makes it possible to understand why today?s calls to free art from aesthetics are misguided and lead to a smothering of both aesthetics and politics in ethics.},

Rather, it is concerned with why this interpretation plays such an important role in demonstrating the contemporary relevance of psychoanalytic concepts. In order for Freud to use the Oedipus complex as a means for the interpretation of texts, it was necessary first of all for a particular notion of Oedipus, belonging to the Romantic reinvention of Greek antiquity, to have produced a certain idea of the power of the thought that does not think, and the power of the speech that remains silent. From this it does not follow that the Freudian unconscious was already prefigured by the aesthetic unconscious. Freud's "aesthetic" analyses reveal instead a tension between the two forms of unconscious. --From publisher's description},

In this fascinating collection, Rancière engages in a radical critique of some of his major contemporaries on questions of art and politics: Gilles Deleuze, Antonio Negri, Giorgio Agamben, Alain Badiou and Jacques Derrida. The essays show how Rancière's ideas can be used to analyse contemporary trends in both art and politics, including the events surrounding 9/11, war in the contemporary consensual age, and the ethical turn of aesthetics and politics. Rancière elaborates new directions for the concepts of politics and communism, as well as the notion of what a 'politics of art' might be. This important collection includes several essays that have never previously been published in English, as well as a brand new afterword. Together these essays serve as a superb introduction to the work of one of the world's most influential contemporary thinkers.},

The masses subjected to the society of spectacle have traditionally been seen as aesthetically and politically passive - in response, both artists and thinkers have sought to transform the spectator into an active agent and the spectacle into a performance. In this follow-up to the acclaimed "The Future of the Image", Ranciere takes a radically different approach to this attempted emancipation. Beginning by asking exactly what we mean by political art or the politics of art, he goes on to look at what the tradition of critical art, and the desire to insert art into life, has achieved. Has the militant critique of the consumption of images and commodities become, instead, a melancholic affirmation of their omnipotence?},

  abstract = {What has philosophy to do with the poor? If, as has often been supposed, the poor have no time for philosophy, then why have philosophers always made time for them? Why is the history of philosophy—from Plato to Karl Marx to Jean-Paul Sartre to Pierre Bourdieu—the history of so many figures of the poor: plebes, men of iron, the demos, artisans, common people, proletarians, the masses? Why have philosophers made the shoemaker, in particular, a remarkably ubiquitous presence in this history? Does philosophy itself depend on this thinking about the poor? If so, can it ever refrain from thinking for them?Jacques Rancière’s The Philosopher and His Poor meditates on these questions in close readings of major texts of Western thought in which the poor have played a leading role—sometimes as the objects of philosophical analysis, sometimes as illustrations of philosophical argument. Published in France in 1983 and made available here for the first time in English, this consummate study assesses the consequences for Marx, Sartre, and Bourdieu of Plato’s admonition that workers should do “nothing else” than their own work. It offers innovative readings of these thinkers’ struggles to elaborate a philosophy of the poor. Presenting a left critique of Bourdieu, the terms of which are largely unknown to an English-language readership, The Philosopher and His Poor remains remarkably timely twenty years after its initial publication.},

But political realists, remarks Jacques Ranciere, are always several steps behind reality, and the only thing which may come to an end with their dominance is democracy. 'We could', he suggests, 'merely smile at the duplicity of the conclusion/suppression of politics which is simultaneously a suppression/conclusion of philosophy.' This is precisely the task which Ranciere undertakes in these subtle and perceptive essays. He argues persuasively that since Plato and Aristotle politics has always constructed itself as the art of ending politics, that realism is itself utopian, and that what has succeeded the polemical forms of class struggle is not the wisdom of a new millennium but the return of old fears, criminality and chaos. Whether he is discussing the confrontation between Mitterrand and Chirac, French working-class discourse after the 1830 revolution, or the ideology of recent student mobilizations, his aim is to restore philosophy to politics and give politics back its original and necessary meaning: the organization of dissent.},

In this truly comparative study, he examines Wordsworth\&\#39;s poetry, the utopian discourse of the Saint-Simoniens, the correspondence and theater of Büchner, Claude Genoux\&\#39;s Mémoires d\&\#39;un enfant de la Savoie, Michelet\&\#39;s theories of history, the prose and poetry of Rilke, and the performance of Ingrid Bergman in Rossellini\&\#39;s postwar film Europe 51.  Rancière examines the various forms of displacement that affect his subjects, enabling each to become foreign to the sites and trajectories commonly known as reality.  He argues convincingly that \&quot;the people\&quot; have no proper signification in the texts under consideration, instead, they function as points of reality upon which the voyager can drape a conceptual framework shaped by the circumstances not of the other, but of the self.},

The first of five wide-ranging and comprehensive volumes, this book provides a detailed exploration of Arabic mathematics and sciences in the ninth and tenth centuries. Extensive and detailed analyses and annotations support a number of key Arabic texts, which are translated here into English for the first time. In this volume Rashed focuses on the traditions of celebrated polymaths from the ninth and tenth centuries 'School of Baghdad' - such as the Ban ︣Ms︣,́ Thb́it ibn Qurra, Ibrh́m̋ ibn Sinń, Ab ︣Jaþfar al-Khźin, Ab ︣Sahl Wayjan ibn Rustḿ al-Qh︣ ̋- and eleventh-century Andalusian mathematicians like Ab ︣al-Qśim ibn al-Samh, and al-Mu'taman ibn Hd︣. The Archimedean-Apollonian traditions of these polymaths are thematically explored to illustrate the historical and epistemological development of 'infinitesimal mathematics' as it became more clearly articulated in the eleventh-century influential legacy of al-Hasan ibn al-Haytham ('Alhazen'). Contributing to a more informed and balanced understanding of the internal currents of the history of mathematics and the exact sciences in Islam, and of its adaptive interpretation and assimilation in the European context, this fundamental text will appeal to historians of ideas, epistemologists, mathematicians at the most advanced levels of research"--},

In both respects we endeavour to contribute to the theory of objects, albeit in a more philosophical than mathematical fashion.},

Organized into themes linked to aspects of code—repetition, transformation,parameters, visualization, and simulation—each of the book's sections contains an essay, code samples, and numerous illustrations. An accompanying website (www.formandcode.com) features code samples in various programming languages for the examples in the book. An ideal introductory text for digital design and media arts courses, this unique primer will also appeal to students and professionals looking for a survey of this exciting new area of artistic production.},

Art theory sets the criteria of what the experience should be, and psychologists examine whether the predicted experience matches the observed experience of the recipient. An important issue is the role of knowledge in artistic evaluation, with resulting demand characteristics and concerns for self-presentation. With the help of recently developed implicit measures, both behavioral and biological, researchers are able to distinguish between explicitly reported knowledge and genuinely felt experience. The author presents examples of how art theory and empirical psychology might interact and how psychology can be used to examine a work's artistic value.},

  title = {Automata: {{A}} Spectacular History of the Mimetic Faculty},
  shorttitle = {Automata},
  author = {Reilly, Kara},
  year = 2006,
  abstract = {This study demonstrates that automata, as mechanized theatrical spectacles created through the lens of the mimetic faculty, were often deployed in the service of Foucauldian power and produced knowledge. There are four interdependent concepts that will be returned to in this study: the mimetic faculty, automata, spectacle and power/knowledge. During the Renaissance, the Council of Florence employed Filipo Brunelleschi to create an ingenious machine that would persuade members of the Eastern Orthodox Church of the correctness of the doctrine of Filioque. Thus, Brunelleschi created an iconophilic spectacle in the service of a theological argument. During the Reformation, Protestants banned Catholic icons; they worried that art might surpass nature. Instead of disappearing altogether, these icons resurface in the emerging popular theatre, particularly in the form of moving statues. Moving statues are precursors to seventeenth-century automata, such as the hydraulic automata in the grottoes at Saint-Germain-en-laye. Built by the Florentine scenographers, Tomaso and Alessandro Francini, these hydraulic tableaux vivants directly influenced Descartes' writings on the mechanical philosophy, particularly his concept of the rational soul versus the animal-machine. Jacques Vaucanson's eighteenth-century automata had a tremendous impact upon important figures of the Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution through the concept of object-based mimesis, particularly upon the work of Julien Offray de la Mettrie, Francois Quesnay, Adam Smith, and Charles Babbage. The chess-playing Turk, an automaton imposter known as the "thinking machine," helped produce the discourse of orientalism. The nineteenth-century performance legacy of Olympia from E.T.A. Hoffmann's tale "The Sandman" indicates that female automata reflect male sexual desires, even helping to produce the discourse of fetishism and the uncanny. Automata even come to represent luxury items by marketing products in store windows, demonstrating the nineteenth century movement toward a culture of conspicuous consumption. Through an exploration of the use of the imaginative mimetic faculty to create spectacular automata that produces Foucauldian power/knowledge, this study offers a genealogy of spectacle and mimesis in the hopes that "the role for theory today" still "seems to be...to analyze the specificity of the mechanisms of power, to locate the connections and extensions, to build little by little strategic knowledge." 1 1 Michel Foucault, "Power and Strategies," Power/Knowledge , ed.

  abstract = {"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." -Albert Einstein  Our everyday lives are filled with a massive flow of information that we must interpret in order to understand the world we live in. Considering the complex variety of data floating around us, sometimes the best-or even only-way to communicate is visually. This unique book presents a fascinating perspective on the subject, highlighting the work of the masters of the profession, creators of breakthroughs that have changed the way we communicate. Information Graphics has been conceived and designed not just for graphics professionals, but for anyone interested in the history and practice of communicating visually.  The in-depth introductory section, illustrated with over 60 images (each accompanied by an explanatory caption), features essays by Sandra Rendgen, Paolo Ciuccarelli, Richard Saul Wurman, and Simon Rogers. Looking back all the way to primitive cave paintings as a means of communication, this section gives readers an excellent overview of the subject. The second part of the book is entirely dedicated to contemporary works by today's most renowned professionals, presenting 200 graphics projects, with over 400 examples-each with a fact sheet and an explanation of methods and objectives-divided into chapters by the topics Location, Time, Category, and Hierarchy.  Includes: 200 projects and over 400 examples of contemporary information graphics from all over the world-ranging from journalism to art, government, education, business and much more Four essays about the development of information graphics since its beginnings},

Kindergarten is becoming more like the rest of school. In~ Lifelong~Kindergarten, learning expert Mitchel Resnick argues for exactly the opposite: the rest of school (even the rest of life) should be more like kindergarten. To thrive in today's fast-changing world, people of all ages must learn to think and act creatively -- and the best way to do that is by focusing more on imagining, creating, playing, sharing, and reflecting, just as children do in traditional kindergartens.Drawing on~experiences from more than thirty years at MIT's Media Lab, Resnick discusses new technologies and strategies for engaging young people in creative learning~experiences. He tells stories of how children~are programming their own games, stories, and inventions (for example, a diary security system, created by a twelve-year-old girl), and~collaborating through remixing, crowdsourcing, and large-scale group projects (such as a Halloween-themed game called Night at~Dreary Castle, produced by more than twenty kids scattered around the world). By providing young people with opportunities to work on projects,~based on their passions, in collaboration with peers, in a playful spirit, we can help them prepare for a world where creative thinking is more important than~ever before.},

The development of the computer as a design environment has encouraged a new breed of digital designer; keen to explore the unique creative potential of the computer as an input/output device. Data-driven Graphic Design introduces the creative potential of computational data and how it can be used to inform and create everything from typography, print and moving graphics to interactive design and physical installations. Using code as a creative environment allows designers to step outside the boundaries of commercial software tools, and create a set of unique, digitally informed pieces of work. The use of code offers a new way of thinking about and creating design for the digital environment.Each chapter outlines key concepts and techniques, before exploring a range of innovative projects through case studies and interviews with the artists and designers who created them. These provide an inspirational, real-world context for every technique. Finally each chapter concludes with a Code section, guiding you through the process of experimenting with each technique yourself (with sample projects and code examples using the popular Processing language supplied online to get you started).},

  abstract = {This article is an investigation of boredom in the company of screen-based media. Working across film theory, media theory, affect theory, and game studies, the author argues that boredom is at once a useful counterexample to the common presumption of a saturating aesthetic encounter in film and media studies, and an affective correlate to media theory’s figure of the withdrawal of digital technics from the grasp of human perception and attention. Furthermore, he argues that boredom is not necessarily something we wish to avoid, but rather a relational state that we sometimes aim to achieve in relation to media objects that are not engrossing, interesting, engaging, beautiful. His argument unfolds across three stages: a description of modernist ‘profound boredom’ in Andy Warhol’s early film ‘Stillies’, in which boredom is converted into interest by means of intellection or criticism; a theorization of the ‘vulgar boredom’ of mass culture, in relation to Christopher Nolan’s Inception, using psychoanalytical object-relations theory to help understand what happens when we seek out cinematic or mediatic boredom; and finally, a discussion of these results derived from the cinema in relation to King’s blockbuster casual game, Candy Crush Saga.},

The role of technology in musical production has cast music into data (a tangible entity, commodity or product) and thus made data a kind of cultural object itself in certain contexts (LPs, CDs, MP3 files). This condition suggests that a rethinking/transformation of contemporary audio arts based on process is taking place. Increasingly, sound may be only one of several simultaneous and expressive components constituting a cultural experience. Here process can suggest and define a set of possibilities as an artistic statement irrespective of whether something or anything is manifest by any artist. With the environment saturated with music, the creative design of musical processes might become an art in itself.},

  abstract = {How will our increasingly digital civilization persist beyond our lifetimes? Audio and videotapes demagnetize; CDs delaminate; Internet art links to websites that no longer exist; Amiga software doesn't run on iMacs. In  Re-collection, Richard Rinehart and Jon Ippolito argue that the vulnerability of new media art illustrates a larger crisis for social memory. They describe a  variable media approach to rescuing new media, distributed across producers and consumers who can choose appropriate strategies for each endangered work. New media art poses novel preservation and conservation dilemmas. Given the ephemerality of their mediums, software art, installation art, and interactive games may be heading to obsolescence and oblivion. Rinehart and Ippolito, both museum professionals, examine the preservation of new media art from both practical and theoretical perspectives, offering concrete examples that range from Nam June Paik to Danger Mouse. They investigate three threats to twenty-first-century creativity: technology, because much new media art depends on rapidly changing software or hardware; institutions, which may rely on preservation methods developed for older mediums; and law, which complicates access with intellectual property constraints such as copyright and licensing. Technology, institutions, and law, however, can be enlisted as allies rather than enemies of ephemeral artifacts and their preservation. The variable media approach that Rinehart and Ippolito propose asks to what extent works to be preserved might be medium-independent, translatable into new mediums when their original formats are obsolete.},

A controlled experiment with repeated measures design and within-subjects differences was performed with fifteen subjects, comparing Groxis, Inc.’s Grokker – their clustering product – a zoomable user interface, their textual clustering product and Vivisimo’s textual clustering product. No significant differences were found for objective measures. However, there were significant differences for subjective measures. The textual clustering interfaces was preferred and elicited major satisfaction among the users. Results are summarized in both a quantitative and qualitative format.},

  abstract = {A unique guide to practical mechanical design principles and their applications In Making Things Move, you'll learn how to build moving mechanisms through non-technical explanations, examples, and do-it-yourself projects--from art installations to toys to labor-saving devices. The projects include a drawing machine, a mini wind turbine, a mousetrap powered car, and more, but the applications of the examples are limited only by your imagination. A breadth of topics is covered ranging from how to attach couplers and shafts to a motor, to converting between rotary and linear motion. Each chapter features photographs, drawings, and screenshots of the components and systems involved. Emphasis is placed on using off-the-shelf components whenever possible, and most projects also use readily available metals, plastics, wood, and cardboard, as well as accessible fabrication techniques such as laser cutting. Small projects in each chapter are designed to engage you in applying the material in the chapter at hand. Later in the book, more involved projects incorporate material from several chapters. Making Things Move: Focuses on practical applications and results, not abstract engineering theories Contains more than a dozen topic-focused projects and three large-scale projects incorporating lessons from the whole book Features shopping lists and guides to off-the-shelf components for the projects Incorporates discussions of new fabrication techniques such as laser cutting and 3D printing, and how you can gain access Includes online component for continuing education with the book's companion website and blog (makingthingsmove.com) Hands-on coverage of moving mechanisms Introduction to Mechanisms and Machines; Materials and Where to Find Them; Screwed or Glued?

  abstract = {This history of computing focuses not on chronology (what came first and who deserves credit for it) but on the actual architectures of the first machines that made electronic computing a practical reality. The book covers computers built in the United States, Germany, England, and Japan. It makes clear that similar concepts were often pursued simultaneously and that the early researchers explored many architectures beyond the von Neumann architecture that eventually became canonical. The contributors include not only historians but also engineers and computer pioneers.An introductory chapter describes the elements of computer architecture and explains why "being first" is even less interesting for computers than for other areas of technology. The essays contain a remarkable amount of new material, even on well-known machines, and several describe reconstructions of the historic machines. These investigations are of more than simply historical interest, for architectures designed to solve specific problems in the past may suggest new approaches to similar problems in today's machines.Contributors : Titiimaea F.

Ultimately, the book shows the continuing relevance of the often uncomfortable questions Kittler opened up about the cultural production and its technological entanglements.},

It differs from previous discussions of Marxist aesthetic theory in looking at Marx's views from an art-historical rather than from a literary perspective, and in placing those views in the context of the art practices, theories, and policies of Marx's own time. Dr Rose begins her work by discussing Marx's planned treatise on Romantic art of 1842 against the background of the philosophical debates, cultural policies, and art practices of the 1840s, and looks in particular at the patronage given to the group of German artists known as the 'Nazarenes' in those years, who are discussed in relation to both the English Pre-Raphaelites, popular in the London known to Marx, and to the Russian Social Realists of the 1860s. The author goes on to consider claims of twentieth-century Marxist art theories and practices to have represented Marx's own views on art. The book the conflicting claims made on Marx's views by the Soviet avant-garde Constructivists of the 1920s and of the Socialist Realists who followed them are considered, and are related back to the aesthetic theories and practices discussed in the earlier chapters.},

  abstract = {When Zagreb was the epicenter of explorations into the aesthetic potential of the new “thinking machines.”This book documents a short but intense artistic experiment that took place in Yugoslavia fifty years ago but has been influential far beyond that time and place: the “little-known story” of the advent of computers in art. It was through the activities of the New Tendencies movement, begun in Zagreb in 1961, and its supporting institution the Galerija suvremene umjetnosti that the “thinking machine” was adopted as an artistic tool and medium. Pursuing the idea of “art as visual research,” the New Tendencies movement proceeded along a path that led from Concrete and Constructivist art, Op art, and Kinetic art to computer-generated graphics, film, and sculpture. With their exhibitions and conferences and the 1968 launch of the multilingual, groundbreaking magazine Bit International, the New Tendencies transformed Zagreb—already one of the most vibrant artistic centers in Yugoslavia—into an international meeting place where artists, engineers, and scientists from both sides of the Iron Curtain gathered around the then-new technology. For a brief moment in time, Zagreb was the epicenter of explorations of the aesthetic, scientific, and political potential of the computer. This volume documents that exhilarating period. It includes new essays by Jerko Denegri, Darko Fritz, Margit Rosen, and Peter Weibel; many texts that were first published in New Tendencies exhibition catalogs and Bit International magazine; and historic documents. More than 650 black-and-white and color illustrations testify to the astonishing diversity of the exhibited artworks and introduce the movement's protagonists. Many of the historic photographs, translations, and documents are published here for the first time. Taken together, the images and texts offer the long overdue history of the New Tendencies experiment and its impact on the art of the twentieth century.},

  abstract = {Mapping the possibilities of photofilmic imagesThis book explores the multifarious ways in which art, cinema, and other forms of visual culture respond to a digitized and networked world. Traditional discourses on medium specificity, developed in distinct disciplines, often fail to provide an adequate description of the transformations that photography and film have undergone. The essays, written by internationally renowned scholars, encompass a broad range of different forms such as video, documentary film, cinema, photography, and the Internet, as well as varied fields such as art history, film studies, photography theory, visual culture studies, and media theory. In this way they deal with heterogeneous practices or techniques ranging from panoramas, drone surveillance, tableau vivant, press coverage, computer-based editing, digitized financial markets, and various concepts such as temporality and contemporaneity, eco-aesthetics and forensic practice, countervisuality, human rights and political imagination, social transparency and control, thus charting the possibilities of the continuous border-crossing movement between photographic and filmic images within contemporary art and visual culture. This volume also contains, as an artist’s contribution, a substantial and richly illustrated interview with Eric Baudelaire.Contributors:Eric Baudelaire (Paris), Brianne Cohen (Amherst College), Stefanie Diekmann (University of Hildesheim), Evgenia Giannouri (Paris 3 Sorbonne Nouvelle), Lilian Haberer (University of Cologne), Jana J.

Data from videos of snail embryos used to map physiological function during development using conventional (scientific) diagrams were “remapped” as sound projections into a three-dimensional building space, transposing scientific knowledge into a public experience as a “mutable mobile.”},

In the past fifty years especially, ideas about time and duration have reinstated narrative in art, via filmmaking and video, the theatricality of happenings, performance and installation art, digitally manipulated photography, and virtual reality.This pioneering book, originally published in 1999 under the title New Media in Late 20th-Century Art, discusses the most influential artists internationally-from Eadweard Muybridge to Robert Rauschenberg, Bill Viola, and Pipilotti Rist-and those seminal works that have radically transformed the map of world art. For this new and expanded edition, the book has been brought completely up to date to include the latest in digital work as technology takes art in new directions.},

Yet these disturbing images are at odds with a faith that most adherents--who now number over a billion worldwide--would regard as no less pacific than Buddhism or Christianity. Indeed, the word Islam in Arabic means "self-surrender" and is closely related to salaam, the word for peace. In  this thoroughly revised new edition, Malise Ruthven offers a balance, compact, and reliable overview of Islam. An internationally recognized authority on Islam, Ruthven offers essential insights into this major world religion, examining such issues as why Islam has such major divisions between movements such as the Shi'ites, the Sunnis, and the Wahhabis, and the central importance of the Shar'ia (Islamic law) in Islamic life. He also provides fresh perspectives on contemporary questions: Why is the greatest Jihad (holy war) now against the enemies of Islam, rather than the struggle against evil? Can women find fulfillment in Islamic societies? How must Islam adapt as it confronts the modern world? For the new edition, Ruthven brings the text up-to-date, shedding light on some of the most significant changes in the Muslim world in recent years; from the emergence of al-Qaeda and the attacks on New York and Washington on 9/11 and the ensuing wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, to the uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa. Ruthven includes a new chapter on "Globalized Islam," which examines the effects of economic globalization, the impact of international events in Middle Eastern countries, the questions surrounding Islam and democracy, and the reception and perception of Islam in the West.},

The author's position is that video mutated from a countercultural gesture to an art genre. The question asked is how this genre will articulate its own genealogy.},

In this passionate manifesto, Moshe Safdie argues that as crucibles for creative, social, and political interaction, vital cities are an organic and necessary part of human civilization. If we are to rescue them from dispersal and decay, we must first revise our definition of what constitutes a city.Unlike many who believe that we must choose between cities and suburbs, between mass transit and highways, between monolithic highrises and panoramic vistas, Safdie envisions a way to have it all. Effortless mobility throughout a region of diverse centers, residential communities, and natural open spaces is the key to restoring the rich public life that cities once provided while honoring our profound desire for privacy, flexibility, and freedom. With innovations such as transportation nodes, elevated moving sidewalks, public utility cars, and buildings designed to maximize daylight, views, and personal interaction, Safdie's proposal challenges us all to create a more satisfying and humanistic environment.},

Dan Saffer has done an amazing job synthesizing the chaos into an understandable, ordered reference that is a bookshelf must-have for anyone thinking of creating new designs.”— Jared Spool, CEO of User Interface Engineering Interaction design is all around us. If you’ve ever wondered why your mobile phone looks pretty but doesn’t work well, you’ve confronted bad interaction design. But if you’ve ever marveled at the joy of using an iPhone, shared your photos on Flickr, used an ATM machine, recorded a television show on TiVo, or ordered a movie off Netflix, you’ve encountered good interaction design: products that work as well as they look.  Interaction design is the new field that defines how our interactive products behave. Between the technology that powers our devices and the visual and industrial design that creates the products’ aesthetics lies the practice that figures out how to make our products useful, usable, and desirable. This thought-provoking new edition of Designing for Interaction offers the perspective of one of the most respected experts in the field, Dan Saffer. This book will help you   learn to create a design strategy that differentiates your product from the competition    use design research to uncover people’s behaviors, motivations, and goals in order to design for them   employ brainstorming best practices to create innovativenew products and solutions   understand the process and methods used to define product behavior  It also offers interviews and case studies from industry leaders on prototyping, designing in an Agile environment, service design, ubicomp, robots, and more.},

In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, as the Western powers built empires that stretched from Australia to the West Indies, Western artists created masterpieces ranging from Mansfield Park to Heart of Darkness and Aida. Yet most cultural critics continue to see these phenomena as separate. Edward Said looks at these works alongside those of such writers as W. B. Yeats, Chinua Achebe, and Salman Rushdie to show how subject peoples produced their own vigorous cultures of opposition and resistance. Vast in scope and stunning in its erudition, Culture and Imperialism reopens the dialogue between literature and the life of its time.},

  abstract = {As pop culture, games are as important as film or television—but game design has yet to develop a theoretical framework or critical vocabulary. In Rules of Play Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman present a much-needed primer for this emerging field. They offer a unified model for looking at all kinds of games, from board games and sports to computer and video games. As active participants in game culture, the authors have written Rules of Play as a catalyst for innovation, filled with new concepts, strategies, and methodologies for creating and understanding games..Building an aesthetics of interactive systems, Salen and Zimmerman define core concepts like "play," "design," and "interactivity." They look at games through a series of eighteen "game design schemas," or conceptual frameworks, including games as systems of emergence and information, as contexts for social play, as a storytelling medium, and as sites of cultural resistance.Written for game scholars, game developers, and interactive designers, Rules of Play is a textbook, reference book, and theoretical guide. It is the first comprehensive attempt to establish a solid theoretical framework for the emerging discipline of game design.},

  abstract = {The histories of liveness entwining theater and media technologies have traditionally emphasized the tension between the mediated (not real time) and the live (that which takes place in its moment of presence). These arguments have been well rehearsed, with performance studies scholars like Philip Auslander and Peggy Phelan debating the body’s disappearance into Baudrillardian image simulacra to more recent studies who view electronic images as the central technology for performance. An alternative history that is largely unknown to new media scholars and practitioners, however, is that of theater scenography: the technological fusion of scenery, lighting, costumes and media which has been exemplified in the radical work of early 20th century artists like El Lissitzky, Moholy-Nagy, Kiesler, Tatlin, Svoboda and more recent projects from architects like Herzog/De Meuron and Coop Himmelb(l)au. This paper will survey the historical practices of three specific early twentieth century artists/designers (Vsevolod Meyerhold, Lyubov Popova and Frederick J. Kiesler) who sought not only to re-conceive the stage as hybrid machine and organism with the new technologies of their time but also have redefined liveness through the transformation and folding of the human performer into novel assemblies of mechanical and material expression; machines that exhibit behaviors and dynamics that, while ìlive,î are decidedly not human.},

(the three paradigms of HCI. Paper presented at the Conference on human factors in computing systems. https: //people .cs.vt.edu/\textasciitilde srh/Downlo ads/TheThr eePar adigm sofHC I.pdf, 2007) as a third research paradigm and similarly Bødker (when second wave HCI meets third-wave challenges.

Although this particular focus on experience has provided some novel avenues of academic enquiry, this article draws attention to a distinct bridge between the conventional HCI disciplinary concerns with predominantly task-based digital work and use context and a growing business interest in consumer experiences in digital environments. Critical HCI addresses the problem of experience in two interrelated ways. On one hand, it explores the role market logic plays in putting user experiences to work. On the other hand, it engages with ontological understandings of experience hitherto realized in HCI by way of a phenomenological matrix (Harrison et al. The three paradigms of HCI. Paper presented at the Conference on human factors in computing systems. https://people.cs.vt.edu/\textasciitilde srh/Downloads/TheThreeParadigmsofHCI.pdf, 2007). The article concludes by bringing in an old thinker (A. N. Whitehead) to consider experience in novel ways that relate ontological concerns to a broader political concept of experience capitalism.},

In fact, by showing how individual autonomy is now being generated through technological and cultural automation, Samuels posits that we must rethink modernity and postmodernity. Part of this rethinking entails stressing how the progressive political aspects of postmodernism need to be separated from the aesthetic consumption of differences in automoderntiy. Choosing culturally relevant studies of The Matrix, Grand Theft Auto, Eminem and Jurassic Park, he interprets these medias through the lens of eminent theorists like Slavoj Zizek, Frederic Jameson, and Henry Jenkins. Ultimately, he argues that what defines postmodernity is the stress on social construction, secular humanism, and progressive social movements that challenge the universality and neutrality of modern reason"--Provided by publisher},

  author = {Sandqvist, Tom},
  year = 2006,
  publisher = {MIT Press},
  abstract = {Dada—perhaps the most famous and outrageous of modernism's artistic movements—is said to have begun at the Cabaret Voltaire, a literary evening staged at the restaurant Meierei in Zurich on February 5, 1916. The evening featured stamping, roaring, banging on the lids of pots and pans, and the recitation of incomprehensible "poemes simultanes" Thus a global revolution in art and culture was born in a Swiss restaurant. Or was it?In Dada East, Tom Sandqvist shows that Dada did not spring full-grown from a Zurich literary salon but grew out of an already vibrant artistic tradition in Eastern Europe—particularly Romania—that was transposed to Switzerland when a group of Romanian modernists settled in Zurich. Bucharest and other cities in Romania had been the scene of Dada-like poetry, prose, and spectacle in the years before World War I. One of the leading lights was Tristan Tzara, who began his career in avant-garde literature at fifteen when he cofounded the magazine Simbolul. Tzara—who himself coined the term "Dada," inspired by an obscure connection of his birthday to an Orthodox saint—was at the Cabaret Voltaire that night, along with fellow Romanians Marcel, Jules, and Georges Janco and Arthur Segal. It's not a coincidence, Sandqvist argues, that so many of the first dadaist group were Romanians. Sandqvist traces the artistic and personal transformations that took place in the "little Paris of the Balkans" before they took center stage elsewhere, finding sources as varied as symbolism, futurism, and folklore. He points to a connection between Romanian modernists and the Eastern European Yiddish tradition; Tzara, the Janco brothers, and Segal all grew up within Jewish culture and traditions.For years, the communist authorities in Romania disowned and disavowed Romania's avant-garde movements. Now, as archives and libraries are opening to Western scholars, Tom Sandqvist tells the secret history of Dada's Romanian roots.},

  abstract = {The First Maker-Friendly Guide to Electric Motors!  Makers can do amazing things with motors. Yes, they’re more complicated than some other circuit elements, but with this book, you can completely master them. Once you do, incredible new projects become possible.  Unlike other books, Motors for Makers is 100\% focused on what you can do. Not theory. Making. First, Matthew Scarpino explains how electric motors work and what you need to know about each major type: stepper, servo, induction, and linear motors. Next, he presents detailed instructions and working code for interfacing with and controlling servomotors with Arduino Mega, Raspberry Pi, and BeagleBone Black. All source code and design files are available for you to download from motorsformakers.com. From start to finish, you’ll learn through practical examples, crystal-clear explanations, and photos. If you’ve ever dreamed of what you could do with electric motors, stop dreaming...and start making!  Understand why electric motors are so versatile and how they work Choose the right motor for any project Build the circuits needed to control each type of motor Program motor control with Arduino Mega, Raspberry Pi, or BeagleBone Black Use gearmotors to get the right amount of torque Use linear motors to improve speed and precision Design a fully functional electronic speed control (ESC) circuit Design your own quadcopter Discover how electric motors work in modern electric vehicles--with a fascinating inside look at Tesla’s patents for motor design and control!},

Martin’s series of fantasy novels. The system collects content from the Web sites of Anglo-American news media as well as from four social media platforms: Twitter, Facebook, Google+ and YouTube. An interactive dashboard with trend charts and synchronized visual analytics components not only shows how often Game of Thrones events and characters are being mentioned by journalists and viewers, but also provides a real-time account of concepts that are being associated with the unfolding storyline and each new episode. Positive or negative sentiment is computed automatically, which sheds light on the perception of actors and new plot elements.},

  abstract = {With studies like Discourse Networks 1800/1900 and Gramophone, Film, Typewriter, Friedrich A. Kittler contributed significantly to transforming the history of media into a vital field of inquiry. This essay undertakes to more precisely characterize Kittler’s historiographical approach. When we look back on his early contributions to studies of the relationship between literature, madness and truth – among others, his doctoral dissertation on the Swiss poet and writer Conrad Ferdinand Meyer – what strikes us is the significance that Jacques Lacan’s structuralist psychoanalysis had in shaping the orientation of Kittler’s later studies. His intensive engagement with Lacan galvanized Kittler’s concern with the question of sex and/or gender in the evolution of the humanities as well as his concern with the media history of the university. At the same time, Kittler’s reliance on Lacan led him to a kind of history that is interested above all in the internal logic of discourse. As we see, for instance, in Kittler’s anecdotic treatment of 19thcentury physiologist Hermann von Helmholtz, this historiography does not involve any original research in archives and/or museums. Rather, it builds upon existing historical accounts and focuses its analyses on the issue of symbolic structures. Instead of investigating the history of the material culture of science and technology, what is thereby ultimately reinforced is a philosophical idealism in which knowledge and paranoia become superimposed in and by means of an ‘original syntax’ (Lacan).},

Most of us approach this task by converting a written document into slides, but the result is often a text-heavy presentation saddled with bullet points, stock images, and graphs too complex for an audience to decipher—much less understand. Presenting is fundamentally different from writing, and with only a little more time, a little more effort, and a little more planning, you can communicate your work with force and clarity.Designed for presenters of scholarly or data-intensive content, Better Presentations details essential strategies for developing clear, sophisticated, and visually captivating presentations. Following three core principles—visualize, unify, and focus—Better Presentations describes how to visualize data effectively, find and use images appropriately, choose sensible fonts and colors, edit text for powerful delivery, and restructure a written argument for maximum engagement and persuasion. With a range of clear examples for what to do (and what not to do), the practical package offered in Better Presentations shares the best techniques to display work and the best tactics for winning over audiences. It pushes presenters past the frustration and intimidation of the process to more effective, memorable, and persuasive presentations.},

Under the heading transposition, seventeen artists, musicians, and theorists explain how one thing may turn into another in a spatio-temporal play of identity and difference that has the power to expand into the unknown.While it does not attempt to define the still evolving field of artistic research, through the idea of transposition this book aims to grasp a quality increasingly important to artistic practice because representational approaches have been losing traction. Taking to heart the lessons of deconstruction, new modes of epistemic relationships are being invented that include aesthetic dimensions. Working with materially concrete positions in a manner familiar to artists can ensure that knowledge does not decay into relativism.Contributors: Annette Arlander (University of the Arts Helsinki), Paulo de Assis (Orpheus Institute, Ghent), Rosi Braidotti (Utrecht University), Leif Dahlberg (Royal Institute of Technology Stockholm), Lucia D’Errico (Orpheus Institute, Ghent), Mika Elo (University of the Arts Helsinki), Laura González (Royal Conservatoire of Scotland), Esa Kirkkopelto (University of the Arts Helsinki), Yve Lomax (Royal College of Art, London), Cecile Malaspina (CNRS-Université Paris 1/Université Paris 7), Tor-Finn Malum Fitje (independent artist, Oslo), Dieter Mersch (Zurich University of the Arts), David Pirrò (University of Music and Performing Arts Graz), Hans-Jörg Rheinberger (Max Planck Institute for the History of Science, Berlin), Hanns Holger Rutz (University of Music and Performing Arts Graz), Michael Schwab (Orpheus Institute, Ghent/University of Applied Arts Vienna), Birk Weiberg (Zurich University of the Arts)},

  abstract = {Data visualization is regularly promoted for its ability to reveal stories within data, yet these “data stories” differ in important ways from traditional forms of storytelling. Storytellers, especially online journalists, have increasingly been integrating visualizations into their narratives, in some cases allowing the visualization to function in place of a written story. In this paper, we systematically review the design space of this emerging class of visualizations. Drawing on case studies from news media to visualization research, we identify distinct genres of narrative visualization. We characterize these design differences, together with interactivity and messaging, in terms of the balance between the narrative flow intended by the author (imposed by graphical elements and the interface) and story discovery on the part of the reader (often through interactive exploration). Our framework suggests design strategies for narrative visualization, including promising under-explored approaches to journalistic storytelling and educational media.},

Based on his general social theory, he develops a unique organization theory that challenges existing perceptions of organizations. This volume intends to provide access to the concepts of Luhmann's theory, to present an overview of those parts of his work relevant for organizational studies, and to stimulate further research by providing new applications of his theory to questions for organization and management.

This reflects a timely research agenda that aims to have significant implications on the future of exhibiting and archiving the broad range of creative practice in this field. These fundamental research questions also have relevance across a number of practice based research fields including performance arts and the ephemeral nature of open-system interactive artworks. The objective of this paper is to propose research methods that will approach the question of how to accurately document and archive this transient creative practice that is so often reliant on its cultural and historic context. The preservation and documentation of this work is extremely problematic when we consider the innate issues of (dis)embodiment in relation to presence and intimacy, as experienced and performed in telematic and virtual environments. How can it become possible to reencounter a performance of dispersed and expanded bodies, multiple and interconnected identities, spectral representations and auras; in short, at hybrid bodies (/selves) made of flesh and digital technologies, and the intimate connections between them.},

According to this, the domain of art can also be seen as an operationally closed and self-referential communicative system. The basic problem in these notions lies in the way in which their description of the relationships existing between different systems is only in very narrow terms. Consequently they partially ignore the present process of de-differentiation which has noticeably changed the status of art in society. Instead, Luhmann's ideas expressly emphasize that functional differentiation is an ongoing process. In order to describe the process of de-differentiation, social theory does not need to abandon the concept of autopoiesis, but it does need to understand social systems as interlaced formations which, to an increasing extent, contain common normative and organizational constituents. Because social systems are not altogether self-referential formations, the concept of autopoiesis can describe them only in part. This particular concept of system has been developed in particular by Richard Münch, and as such it forms a productive alternative to the theory of autopoietic social systems.},

  abstract = {Social media websites such as Facebook, Twitter, etc. has changed the way peoples communicate and make decision. In this regard, various companies are willing to use these media to raise their reputation. In this paper, a reputation management system is proposed which measures the reputation of a given company by using the social media data, particularly tweets of Twitter. Taking into account the name of the company and its' related tweets, it is determined that a given tweet has either negative or positive impact on the company's reputation or product. The proposed method is based on N-gram learning approach, which consists of two steps: train step and test step. In the training step, we consider four profiles i.e. positive, negative, neutral, and irrelevant profiles for each company. Then 80\% of the available tweets are used to build the companies' profiles. Each profile contains the terms that have been appeared in the tweets of each company together with the terms' frequencies. Then in the test step, which is performed on the 20\% remaining tweets of the dataset, each tweet is compared with all of the built profiles, based on distance criterion to examine how the given tweet affects a company's reputation. Evaluation of the proposed method indicates that this method has a better efficiency and performance in terms of recall and precision compared to the previous methods such as Neural Network and Bayesian method.},

Short corrects widespread misconceptions of Peirce's theory of signs and demonstrates its relevance to contemporary analytic philosophy of language, mind and science. Peirce's theory of mind, naturalistic but nonreductive, bears on debates of Fodor and Millikan, among others. His theory of inquiry avoids foundationalism and subjectivism, while his account of reference anticipated views of Kripke and Putnam. Peirce's realism falls between 'internal' and 'metaphysical' realism and is more satisfactory than either. His pragmatism is not verificationism; rather, it identifies meaning with potential growth of knowledge. Short distinguishes Peirce's mature theory of signs from his better-known but paradoxical early theory. He develops the mature theory systematically on the basis of Peirce's phenomenological categories and concept of final causation. The latter is distinguished from recent and similar views, such as Brandon's, and is shown to be grounded in forms of explanation adopted in modern science.},

The key difference is often held to be that the Greeks and Romans practiced a "Western Way of War," in which the aim is an open, decisive battle--won by courage instilled, in part, by discipline. Here, Harry Sidebottom looks at how this Western Way of War was constructed and maintained by the Greeks and Romans and why this concept is so prevalent today.All aspects of ancient warfare are thoroughly examined--from philosophy and strategy to the technical skills needed to fight. Sidebottom examines war in the wider context, showing how wars were able to shape classical society, and how an individual's identity was sometimes constructed by war, as in the case of the Christian soldier fighting in God's name. He also explores the ways in which ancient society thought about conflict: Can a war be just? Why was siege warfare particularly bloody? What role did divine intervention play in the outcome of a battle? Taking fascinating examples from the iliad, Tacitus, and the Persian Wars, Sidebottom uses arresting anecdotes and striking visual images to show that any understanding of ancient war is an ongoing process of interpretation.},

Simmel is considered one of the founding fathers of modern sociology but he, like his contemporary Walter Benjamin, wrote about many aspects of life and culture. Simmel's intellectual contributions have long been recognized and he is a keystone in cultural theory of the early 20th century. The essays in this collection are gathered topically and show the wide range of Simmel's thinking even within the arts: aesthetics, landscape, theater, sculpture, literature, and more. Austin Harrington is the brilliant guide behind this substantial volume. He served as editor and translator and also wrote an introduction. Richly informative and thoroughly familiar with Simmel's life and work, Harrington's introduction will itself be an important contribution to the scholarship on Simmel"--},

  abstract = {Few thinkers have been as influential upon current discussions and theoretical practices in the age of media archaeology, philosophy of technology, and digital humanities as the French thinker Gilbert Simondon. Simondon’s prolific intellectual curiosity led his philosophical and scientific reflections to traverse a variety of areas of research, including philosophy, psychology, the beginnings of cybernetics, and the foundations of religion. For Simondon, the human/machine distinction is perhaps not a simple dichotomy. There is much we can learn from our technical objects, and while it has been said that humans have an alienating rapport with technical objects, Simondon takes up the task of a true thinker who sees the potential for humanity to uncover life-affirming modes of technical objects whereby we can discover potentiality for novel, healthful, and dis-alienating rapports with them. For Simondon, by way of studying its genesis, one must grant to the technical object the same ontological status as that of the aesthetic object or even a living being. His work thus opens up exciting new entry points into studying the human’s rapport with its continually changing technical reality. This first complete English-language translation of Gilbert Simondon’s groundbreaking and influential work finally presents to Anglophone readers one of the pinnacle works of France’s most unique thinkers of technics.},

  abstract = {Interactivity has received a great deal of attention in the instructional science literature and has been a much discussed topic on ITFORUM. The attention is well deserved since, by most accounts, interactivity plays a crucial role in knowledge acquisition and the development of cognitive skills. Nevertheless, there has been inadequate analysis of the ways interactivity can be effectively achieved in learning environments. This paper is intended to promote further discussion and analysis of interactivity in learning environments and contains a classification of interaction types appropriate for consideration in multimedia settings. Through an examination of related factors associated with navigation and control, a matrix of interactive dimensions is proposed.},

  month = oct,
  publisher = {MIT Press},
  abstract = {A system can describe what we see (the solar system), operate a computer (Windows 10), or be made on a page (the fourteen engineered lines of a sonnet). In this book, Clifford Siskin shows that system is best understood as a genre -- a form that works physically in the world to mediate our efforts to understand it. Indeed, many Enlightenment authors published works they called "system" to compete with the essay and the treatise. Drawing on the history of system from Galileo's "message from the stars" and Newton's "system of the world" to today's "computational universe," Siskin illuminates the role that the genre of system has played in the shaping and reshaping of modern knowledge. Previous engagements with systems have involved making them, using them, or imagining better ones. Siskin offers an innovative perspective by investigating system itself. He considers the past and present, moving from the "system of the world" to "a world full of systems." He traces the turn to system in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and describes this primary form of Enlightenment as a mediator of political, cultural, and social modernity -- pointing to the moment when people began to "blame the system" for working both too well ("you can't beat the system") and not well enough (it always seems to "break down"). Throughout, his touchstones are: what system is and how it has changed; how it has mediated knowledge; and how it has worked in the world.},

  abstract = {Artists representing their countries at the Venice Biennale face the task of making their work fit into their countrys pavilion. Automatically, the work becomes site and situation specific. While the concept of country specific artwork is archaic in a global world, the most successful presentations confront the tension of representing a country in a pavilion dedicated to it. Krzysztof Wodiczko is the sole artist representing Poland. His work Guests shows how Poland, like the rest of Europe, is adapting to being a country of immigrants. Wodiczkos Polish pavilion is a video installation. The entire interior consists of milky windows behind which we see shadows of people talking to each other, cleaning, doing construction and performing the mundane tasks of life. Upon entering the space one cant help but feel estranged from the conversations and the people on the other side of the windows. The conversations take place in various languages. They tell stories of immigrants from Chechnya, Ukraine, Vietnam, Romania, Pakistan, Morocco living in Poland and Italy. I first saw Krzysztof Wodiczko outside the pavilion arguing with an Austrian woman who was congratulating him on his installation. Wodiczko, who looks like a noble pirate, was asking the woman if she has a maid and whether or not the maid has health care. This snapped the woman out of her glamorous art opening mode and she apologetically explained that while she loves her cleaning lady Maria, getting healthcare for her is beyond her power. Calmly, but very firmly, Wodiczko commanded that she find out about organizations that help immigrant workers and join them upon returning to Austria. I did not expect such activism to develop in the heart of Giardini and asked Pan Wodiczko to elaborate on his politics as well as his aesthetics. The result is the interview above.},

"The YouTube Reader" is the first full-length book to explore YouTube as an industry, archive, and cultural form. This remarkable volume brings together renowned film and media scholars to debate the problems and potential of "broadcasting yourself." "The YouTube Reader" takes on claims of newness, immediacy, and popularity with sytematic and theoretically informed arguments, offering a closer look at the available texts on YouTube and the policies and norms that govern their access and use.

The installation was inspired by Andy Warhol's ironical statement that “in the future everybody will be famous for 15 minutes.” The installation detects human faces and crops them from the wide-angle view of people standing before the installation. Pop-art portraits are then generated by applying randomly selected filters to a randomly chosen face from the audience. These portraits are then shown in 15-second intervals on the flat-panel computer monitor, which is framed as a painting.},

  abstract = {As British colonial rule in Hong Kong waned, a plan was drawn up for the future of the city as an interconnected global metropolis. A US\$ 20-billion public works project, the Airport Core Program, was implemented to ensure global confidence in the city as it transitioned to Chinese rule. The project, typically described in terms of the ten major infrastructure projects that connected the city to global networks, also resulted in the proliferation of a typology particularly adept at integrating these networks into the local context. A unique spatial product of Hong Kong’s postcolonial globalization, these malls represent a mature form of a typology influenced by the city’s unique constraints. This paper demonstrates how podium shopping malls form links between Hong Kong’s global and local infrastructures, underpinning its transition from colonial city to global metropolis.},

Demonstrating the diverse nature and ethnic origin of Jewish people, Solomon explores how the religion has developed in the 2,000 years since the days of the Bible. This Very Short Introduction starts by outlining the basics of practical Judaism, including: festivals, prayers, customs, and various sects - and goes on to consider how Judaism has responded to, and dealt with, a number of key issues and debates, including the impact of the Holocaust and the establishment of the State of Israel. In this new edition, Solomon considers issues of contemporary Judaism in the 21st century, incorporating new material on the relationship between the Muslim faith and Judaism, the rise of Zohar and Kabala, and considers how the faith deals with issues such as homosexuality and gay marriage.ABOUT THE SERIES: The Very Short Introductions series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area. These pocket-sized books are the perfect way to get ahead in a new subject quickly. Our expert authors combine facts, analysis, perspective, new ideas, and enthusiasm to make interesting and challenging topics highly readable.},

  abstract = {Real-Time’ is one of the most frequent concepts used referring to digital media. Despite it is commonly related to immediate feedback, it is not clear when it happens and what its characteristics are, especially in current digital interfaces. Although real-time has been written about very extensively in the context of Human Computer Interaction and Computational Systems, there are few studies evaluating the key features of real-time interaction in other domains. This article attempts to address this situation by proposing a new approach to the concept of real-time interaction driving the analysis of this topic into paradigmatic cases studies in new media, video games and digital artworks.

Unfortunately, this year has seen a major setback for the prospects of an even more extensive plan to collect samples from Mars. In April, the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) made clear that the ballooning cost for the US Mars Sample Return mission to around \$11 billion was too much and the 2040 return date was too distant. NASA has been told to look for ideas to lower costs and shorten the timeline. Shock and anger are palpable in the astronomy community.},

  abstract = {Video is an electronic medium, dependent on the transfer of electronic signals. Video signals are in constant movement, circulating between camera and monitor. This process of simultaneous production and reproduction makes video the most reflexive of media, distinct from both photography and film (in which the image or a sequence of images is central). Because it is processual and not bound to recording and the appearance of a "frame," video shares properties with the computer. In this book, Yvonne Spielmann argues that video is not merely an intermediate stage between analog and digital but a medium in its own right. Video has metamorphosed from technology to medium, with a set of aesthetic languages that are specific to it, and current critical debates on new media still need to recognize this. Spielmann considers video as "transformation imagery," acknowledging the centrality in video of the transitions between images--and the fact that these transitions are explicitly reflected in new processes. After situating video in a genealogical model that demonstrates both its continuities and discontinuities with other media, Spielmann considers three strands of video praxis--documentary, experimental art, and experimental image-making (which is concerned primarily with signal processing). She then discusses selected works by such artists as Vito Acconci, Ulrike Rosenbach, Joan Jonas, Nam June Paik, Peter Campus, Dara Birnbaum, Nan Hoover, Lynn Hershman, Gary Hill, Steina and Woody Vasulka, Bill Seaman, and others. These works serve to demonstrate the spectrum of possibilities in video as medium and point to connections with other forms of media. Finally, Spielmann discusses the potential of interactivity, complexity, and hybridization in the future of video as a medium.Yvonne Spielmann is Professor of Visual Media at Braunschweig University of Art. She lives in Berlin.},

Each chapter tackles a single programming concept, like classes, pointers, and recursion, and open-ended exercises throughout challenge you to apply your knowledge. You'll also learn how to: Split problems into discrete components to make them easier to solve: Make the most of code reuse with functions, classes, and libraries pick the perfect data structure for a particular job: Master more advanced programming tools like recursion and dynamic memory: Organize your thoughts and develop strategies to tackle particular types of problems. Although the book's examples are written in C++, the creative problem-solving concepts they illustrate go beyond any particular language; in fact, they often reach outside the realm of computer science. As the most skillful programmers know, writing great code is a creative art--and the first step in creating your masterpiece is learning to Think Like a Programmer"--},

They are making use of the capacities of complex communication infrastructures, currently dominated by social mass media such as Twitter and Facebook, on which they have come to depend.Amidst a confusing plurality, Felix Stalder argues that are three key constituents of this condition: the use of existing cultural materials for one's own production, the way in which new meaning is established as a collective endeavour, and the underlying role of algorithms and automated decision-making processes that reduce and give shape to massive volumes of data. These three characteristics define what Stalder calls 'the digital condition'. Stalder also examines the profound political implications of this new culture. We stand at a crossroads between post-democracy and the commons, a concentration of power among the few or a genuine widening of participation, with the digital condition offering the potential for starkly different outcomes.This ambitious and wide-ranging theory of our contemporary digital condition will be of great interest to students and scholars in media and communications, cultural studies, and social, political and cultural theory, as well as to a wider readership interested in the ways in which culture and politics are changing today.},

  abstract = {"The art world is bound to the economy," writes Julian Stallabrass, "as tightly as Ahab to the white whale." In Art Incorporated, Stallabrass offers a provocative look at contemporary art and the dramatic changes that have taken place in the last twenty years, illuminating the connections between money, politics, and art. Stallabrass notes that the spectacular crash of 1989 profoundly changed the character of contemporary art, shattering the art-world's self-importance and producing a reaction against art that engaged with theory and politics, in favor of art that set out to awe, entertain, and be sold. He describes the growth of biennials and other art events across the globe in the 1990s, the construction of new museums of contemporary art, and the expansion of many museums already in existence. These activities, Stallabrass writes, have become steadily more commercial, as museums establish alliances with corporations, bring their products closer to commercial culture, and move from modeling themselves on libraries to becoming more like theme parks. In connection with this, he offers an insightful look at installation art, which is often seen as an art that firmly resists buying and selling, pointing out that installations appeal to museums precisely because a work of art that can only be seen on a particular site ensures that viewers have to go there. Shedding light on everything from the greatly increased visibility for women artists, to the intense competition between art and television, to the conservative backlash against notorious works, Art Incorporated provides a frank and penetrating view of the contemporary art world.},

Though he was a prolific writer and an original thinker of vast erudition, Jung lacked a gift for clear exposition, and his ideas are less widely appreciated than they deserve to be. Now, in this extremely accessible introduction, Anthony Stevens--one of Britain's foremost Jungian analysts--clearly explains the basic concepts of Jungian psychology: the collective unconscious, complex, archetype, shadow, persona, anima, animus, and the individualization of the Self. A small masterpiece of insight and concision, this volume offers a clear portrait of one of the twentieth century's most important and controversial thinkers.About the Series: Combining authority with wit, accessibility, and style, Very Short Introductions offer an introduction to some of life's most interesting topics. Written by experts for the newcomer, they demonstrate the finest contemporary thinking about the central problems and issues in hundreds of key topics, from philosophy to Freud, quantum theory to Islam.},

  abstract = {Willem de Kooning is one of the most important artists of the twentieth century, a true “painter’s painter” whose protean work continues to inspire many artists. In the thirties and forties, along with Arshile Gorky and Jackson Pollock, he became a key figure in the revolutionary American movement of abstract expressionism. Of all the painters in that group, he worked the longest and was the most prolific, creating powerful, startling images well into the 1980s.The first major biography of de Kooning captures both the life and work of this complex, romantic figure in American culture. Ten years in the making, and based on previously unseen letters and documents as well as on hundreds of interviews, this is a fresh, richly detailed, and masterful portrait. The young de Kooning overcame an unstable, impoverished, and often violent early family life to enter the Academie in Rotterdam, where he learned both classic art and guild techniques. Arriving in New York as a stowaway from Holland in 1926, he underwent a long struggle to become a painter and an American, developing a passionate friendship with his fellow immigrant Arshile Gorky, who was both a mentor and an inspiration. During the Depression, de Kooning emerged as a central figure in the bohemian world of downtown New York, surviving by doing commercial work and painting murals for the WPA. His first show at the Egan Gallery in 1948 was a revelation. Soon, the critics Harold Rosenberg and Thomas Hess were championing his work, and de Kooning took his place as the charismatic leader of the New York school—just as American art began to dominate the international scene.Dashingly handsome and treated like a movie star on the streets of downtown New York, de Kooning had a tumultuous marriage to Elaine de Kooning, herself a fascinating character of the period. At the height of his fame, he spent his days painting powerful abstractions and intense, disturbing pictures of the female figure—and his nights living on the edge, drinking, womanizing, and talking at the Cedar bar with such friends as Franz Kline and Frank O’Hara. By the 1960s, exhausted by the feverish art world, he retreated to the Springs on Long Island, where he painted an extraordinary series of lush pastorals. In the 1980s, as he slowly declined into what was almost certainly Alzheimer’s, he created a vast body of haunting and ethereal late work.This is an authoritative and brilliant exploration of the art, life, and world of an American master.From the Hardcover edition.},

Across the world, integrated automation, one key result of the so-called ‘data economy’, is leading to a drastic reduction in employment in all areas~- from the legal profession to truck driving, from medicine to stevedoring.In this first volume of a new series, the leading cultural theorist Bernard Stiegler advocates a radical solution to the crisis posed by automation and consumer capitalism more generally. He calls for a decoupling of the concept of ‘labour’ (meaningful, intellectual participation) from ‘employment’ (dehumanizing, banal work), with the ultimate aim of eradicating ‘employment’ altogether. By doing so, new and alternative economic models will arise, where individuals are no longer simply mined for labour, but also actively produce what they consume.Building substantially on his existing theories and engaging with a wide range of figures~- from Deleuze and Foucault to Bill Gates and Alan Greenspan~- Automatic Society will appeal to students and scholars across the social sciences and humanities, as well as anyone concerned with the central question of the future of work.},

  abstract = {French philosopher Bernard Stiegler began his annual lecture series at Nanjing University in 2016, offering eight lectures per year. The first four years of these lectures are included in this volume and amount to a distillation of the movement of his work in this period as well as an engagement with China at a time when its place in the questions about the global future is becoming increasingly central. This movement and this engagement are in fact conjoined, because since 2014 Stiegler's questions have been increasingly concerned with global problems, that is, with thinking the so-called Anthropocene at a profound level and in relation to the philosophical failure to reckon with the manifold and indeed "cosmic" consequences of the entropic and thermodynamic revolution. The first year's lectures introduce these questions via Stiegler's concept of automatic society and technological and speculative questions emerging from the work of Heidegger and Marx. The 2017 lectures begin with the decision of Oxford Dictionaries to make "post-truth" the word of the year, taking this as an opportunity to understand the implications for Heidegger's "history of being", "history of truth" and Gestell, before entering into a lengthy and original consideration of the relationship between Socrates and Plato (and of tragic Greece in general) and its meaning for the history of Western philosophy. The 2018 lectures traverse a path from Foucault's biopower to psychopower to neuropwer, and then to a critique of neuroeconomics, conducted through Stiegler's revision of the Husserlian account of retention to focus on the irreducible connection between human memory and technological memory, culminating in reflections on the significance of neurotechnology in platform capitalism. The 2019 lectures introduce the concept of hyper-matter as necessary for an epistemology that escapes the trap of opposing the material and the ideal, in order to respond to the need for a new critique of the notion of information and technological performativity (of which Moore's law both is and is not an example) in an age when the biosphere has become a technosphere.},

Stiegler's life-long encounter with the work of Martin Heidegger reappears here in pursuit of the question not of what is called "thinking" (penser) but, in a twist on old French, of what is called "caring" (panser) as the possibility of a new therapeutic theory and practice capable of responding to the massive psychological, social and ecological toxicity associated with what, for Stiegler, is the disruptive age of the Entropocene.},

  abstract = {The catastrophic economic, social and political crisis of our time calls for a new and original critique of political economy - a rethinking of Marx's project in the very different conditions of twenty-first century capitalism. Stiegler argues that today the proletarian must be reconceptualized as the economic agent whose knowledge and memory are confiscated by machines. This new sense of the term ‘proletarian' is best understood by reference to Plato's critique of exteriorized memory. By bringing together Plato and Marx, Stiegler can show how a generalized proletarianization now encompasses not only the muscular system, as Marx saw it, but also the nervous system of the so-called creative workers in the information industries. The proletarians of the former are deprived of their practical know-how, whereas the latter are shorn of their theoretical practice, and both suffer from a confiscation of the very possibility of a genuine art of living. But the mechanisms at work in this new and accentuated form of proletarianization are the very mechanisms that may spur a reversal of the process. Such a reversal would imply a crucial distinction between one's life work, originating in otium (leisure devoted to the techniques of the self), and the job, consisting in a negotium (the negotiation and calculation, increasingly restricted to short-term expectations), leading to the necessity of a new conception of economic value. This short text offers an excellent introduction to Stiegler's work while at the same time representing a political call to arms in the face of a deepening economic and social crisis.},

For many years, Stiegler has explored the origins and philosophical, ethical, and political stakes of a global process he calls "the industrial temporalization of consciousness." Here, demonstrating that technology—including alphabetical writing—is memory, he argues that through new technologies of retention and inscription we have come to live in a world where time devours space, a disoriented world in which we have lost our bearings. Immersed in the multimedia of an over-connected world, with time and space as we know them abolished, we no longer find "cardinal points" to guide us and may even be led where we do not wish to go. We must therefore prepare to confront new spheres of ideological control and discover new possibilities in the digital environment.},

  abstract = {What is a technical object? At the beginning of Western philosophy, Aristotle contrasted beings formed by nature, which had within themselves a beginning of movement and rest, and man-made objects, which did not have the source of their own production within themselves. This book, the first of three volumes, revises the Aristotelian argument and develops an innovative assessment whereby the technical object can be seen as having an essential, distinct temporality and dynamics of its own.The Aristotelian concept persisted, in one form or another, until Marx, who conceived of the possibility of an evolution of technics. Lodged between mechanics and biology, a technical entity became a complex of heterogeneous forces. In a parallel development, while industrialization was in the process of overthrowing the contemporary order of knowledge as well as contemporary social organization, technology was acquiring a new place in philosophical questioning. Philosophy was for the first time faced with a world in which technical expansion was so widespread that science was becoming more and more subject to the field of instrumentality, with its ends determined by the imperatives of economic struggle or war, and with its epistemic status changing accordingly. The power that emerged from this new relation was unleashed in the course of the two world wars.Working his way through the history of the Aristotelian assessment of technics, the author engages the ideas of a wide range of thinkers—Rousseau, Husserl, and Heidegger, the paleo-ontologist Leroi-Gourhan, the anthropologists Vernant and Detienne, the sociologists Weber and Habermas, and the systems analysts Maturana and Varela.},

Hybridity itself, however, is often treated as a specifically post-colonial phenomenon. The contribuots in this volume assume the historicity of transcultural flows and entanglements; they consider the resulting transformative powers to be a basic feature of cultural change. By juxtaposing different notions of hybridization and specific methodologies, as they appear in the various disciplines, this volume's design is transdisciplinary. Each author presents a disciplinary concept of hybridization and shows how it operatees in specific case studies. The aim is to generate a transdisciplinary perception of hybridity that paves the way for a wider application of this crucial concept."--Back cover},

  abstract = {This paper deals with the problems of communication as they are analysed in the framework of the systems theory of Niklas Luhmann. For Luhmann modern society is a functionally differentiated society, i.e. it is composed of heterogeneous but equal parts which are relatively independent and are defined as social subsystems. Luhmann’s analysis presents contemporary society as a whole differentiated into functionally dependent yet autonomous sub-systems that constitute neighbouring worlds for each other. This raises the question of the existence or non-existence of potential unifying forces or integration mechanisms. In Luhmann’s view the main problem is the non-existence of means of “metacommunication”. The development of specialised media and codes in the individual sub-systems increases the overall complexity of the social system, but does not entail the metacommunication that would make possible the selfobservation and self-reference of the social system as a whole.},

Great apes and humans, unlike small apes and monkeys, have repeatedly passed mirror tests, suggesting that the underlying brain processes are homologous and evolved 14–18 million years ago. However, neuroscientific, developmental, and clinical dissociations show that the medium used for self-recognition (mirror vs photograph vs video) significantly alters behavioral and brain responses, likely due to perceptual differences among the different media and prior experience. On the basis of this evidence and evolutionary considerations, we argue that the visual self-recognition skills evident in humans and great apes are a byproduct of a general capacity to collate representations, and need not index other aspects of self-awareness.},

  abstract = {In the past two decades, the sonification of scientific data – an auditory equivalent of data visualization in which data are turned into sounds – has become increasingly widespread, particularly as an artistic practice and as a means of popularizing science. Sonification is thus part of the recent trend, discussed in public understanding of science literature, towards increased emphasis on ‘interactivity’ and ‘crossovers’ between science and art as a response to the perceived crisis in the relationship between the sciences and their publics. However, sonification can also be understood as the latest iteration in a long tradition of theorizing the relations between nature, science and human experience. This article analyses the recent public fascination with sonification and argues that sonification grips public imaginations through the promise of sublime experiences. I show how the ‘auditory sublime’ is constructed through varying combinations of technological, musical and rhetorical strategies. Rather than maintain a singular conception of the auditory sublime, practitioners draw on many scientific and artistic repertoires. However, sound is often situated as an immersive and emotional medium in contrast to the supposedly more detached sense of vision. The public sonification discourse leaves intact this dichotomy, reinforcing the idea that sound has no place in specialist science.},

Other beginners’ guides can feel as impenetrable as the original texts to students who "think in images." Contemporary Thinkers Reframed instead uses the language of the arts to explore the usefulness in practice of complex ideas. Short, contemporary and accessible, these lively books utilize actual examples of artworks, films, television shows, works of architecture, fashion and even computer games to explain and explore the work of the most commonly taught thinkers. Conceived specifically for the visually-minded, the series will prove invaluable to students right across the visual arts.Deleuze disdains easy answers. Yet easy answers to Deleuze are what students need. Without reducing Deleuze’s complex body of thought to simplistic solutions, this very contemporary guide leads the reader into the world of Deleuze’s spiralling thought through concrete examples from art, film, TV and even computer games. From Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and The Cell to Pac Man and Doom, and from the work of Robert Mapplethorpe, Coco Fusco and Rachel Whiteread to Lost and Doctor Who, this easily digestible introduction looks at the key ideas promoted by Deleuze, both in his own work and in his notoriously difficult collaborations with Felix Guattari, to make them both fresh and relevant to the visual arts today.},

  abstract = {This article investigates the different shapes in which reading and writing practices occur when paper/pen are compared with keyboard/screen. The focus is on the bodily aspects of these practices. Reading and writing are viewed as techniques of the body, which over the years have become increasingly mediated by technologies. The analysis is grounded in the theory of social practice. Research material consists of written essays collected from 25 students at the University of Jyväskylä, Finland, in 2013. Results show that paper as material is considered suitable and adaptive to numerous reading purposes and bodily positions, while regarding the screen the places and positions of reading are viewed as more limited due to the material boundary conditions presented by devices. Students describe handwriting as a more flexible and relaxed bodily practice than typing, although the worsening skills of handwriting are recognized too. Skills and competences turned out to be less decisive factors than materials and images when trying to explain the differences in reading and writing practices when a paper/pen is compared with a keyboard/screen. Finally, the study argues that digital reading writing interfaces do not determine the ways we read and write as strongly as previously suggested.},

The second is a sustained interrogation of social interaction in and around media. Re-examining issues of representation and interaction, it critically assesses work on the para-social and broadcast sociability, then explores distinct sites of interaction: production communities, audience communities and 'interactivity' with audiences.},

Daniel Sandin's invention, a video synthesizer that artists could build themselves, thereby facilitating the autonomous production of artworks, is discussed. Videotapes generated on the Sandin Image Processor have been exhibited internationally and have received numerous festival prizes. However, these artworks and the circumstances of their making have only been sparsely documented. This article serves to redress this lack by describing key works, including background information about the artists and the technology they used, and by providing references to some exhibitions and video performances, while situating their work in a historical context.},

  abstract = {This thesis represents an historical account of the reception and criticism of computer art from its emergence in 1963 to its crisis in 1989, when aesthetic and ideological differences polarise and eventually fragment the art form. Throughout its history, static-pictorial computer art has been extensively maligned. In fact, no other twentieth-century art form has elicited such a negative and often hostile response. In locating the destabilising forces that affect and shape computer art, this thesis identifies a complex interplay of ideological and discursive forces that influence the way computer art has been and is received by the mainstream artworld and the cultural community at large. One of the central factors that contributed to computer art’s marginality was its emergence in that precarious zone between science and art, at a time when the perceived division between the humanistic and scientific cultures was reaching its apogee. The polarising force inherent in the “two cultures” debate framed much of the prejudice towards early computer art. For many of its critics, computer art was the product of the same discursive assumptions, methodologies and vocabulary as science. Moreover, it invested heavily in the metaphors and mythologies of science, especially logic and mathematics. This close relationship with science continued as computer art looked to scientific disciplines and emergent techno-science paradigms for inspiration and insight. While recourse to science was a major impediment to computer art’s acceptance by the artworld orthodoxy, it was the sustained hostility towards the computer that persistently wore away at the computer art enterprise. The anticomputer response came from several sources, both humanist and anti-humanist. The first originated with mainstream critics whose strong humanist tendencies led them to reproach computerised art for its mechanical sterility. A comparison with aesthetically and theoretically similar art forms of the era reveals that the criticism of computer art is motivated by the romantic fear that a computerised surrogate had replaced the artist. Such usurpation undermined some of the keystones of modern Western art, such as notions of artistic “genius” and “creativity”. Any attempt to rationalise the human creative faculty, as many of the scientists and technologists were claiming to do, would for the humanist critics have transgressed what they considered the primordial mystique of art.  Criticism of computer art also came from other quarters. Dystopianism gained popularity in the 1970s within the reactive counter-culture and avant-garde movements. Influenced by the pessimistic and cynical sentiment of anti-humanist writings, many within the arts viewed the computer as an emblem of rationalisation, a powerful instrument in the overall subordination of the individual to the emerging technocracy},

In the absence of formal training few people are prepared for the responsibilities of dealing with management reports, budgets and capital proposals, and find themselves embarrassed by their lack of understanding.This book is a practical guide to understanding and managing financial responsibilities: 'how to assemble a budget', 'how to read variances on a report', 'how to construct a proposal to invest in new equipment'. By taking the actual things that managers have to do, each chapter explores the range of principles that can be applied, illustrate practical ways the principles are used and provide guidance for implementation.

  abstract = {The "theory of the productive forces" should not be confused with the Marxist analysis of productive forces. The theory of the productive forces (sometimes referred to as productive force determinism) is a widely disseminated variation of historical materialism and Marxism that places primary emphasis on technical advances as the basis for advances and changes in the social structure and culture of a given civilization. The relative strength assigned to the role of technical (or technological) progress in impacting society and social advancement differs among different schools of Marxist thinkers. A related concept is technological determinism. On a prescriptive level, this view places a strong emphasis on the necessity of strengthening the productive forces of the economy as a precondition for the realization of socialism, and within a nominally socialist economy, essential to achieving communism. This theory was held by many Orthodox Marxists as well as Marxist-Leninists; as a result, it played a crucial role in informing the economic policies of current and former socialist states.},

Du Bois's groundbreaking charts, graphs, and maps presented at the 1900 Paris Exposition.Famed sociologist, writer, and Black rights activist W.E.B. Du Bois fundamentally changed the representation of Black Americans with his exhibition of data visualizations at the 1900 Paris Exposition. Beautiful in design and powerful in content, these data portraits make visible a wide spectrum of African American culture, from advances in education to the lingering effects of slavery. They convey a literal and figurative representation of what he famously referred to as "the color line," collected here in full color for the first time.A landmark collection for social history, graphic design, and data science, these visualizations and infographics were far ahead of their time. This comprehensive publication gives modern readers a chance to explore and enjoy:  Colorful graphs and charts that are mesmerizing pieces of art in their own right  Content that makes a valuable companion to W.E.

Systems theory anticipates stochastic convergences in nature, defying the classic certitude of the teleological notion of form. Evidence for this paradigmatic shift is found in the biocybernetic creatures conceived by these roboticists. In much biocybernetic art, beauty emerges in the form of adaptive mechanisms, such as in robotic tetrapods or self-organizing artificial plants. Such structures provide a template for survival mechanisms in an increasingly entropic environment.},

The book includes case studies of such earlier media as the book, the phonograph, early cinema, and television. It also examines contemporary digital forms, exploring their promise and strangeness. A final section probes aspects of visual culture in such environments as the evolving museum, movie spectaculars, and "the virtual window."The contributors reject apocalyptic scenarios of media revolution, demonstrating instead that media transition is always a mix of tradition and innovation, an accretive process in which emerging and established systems interact, shift, and collude with one another.},

  abstract = {Fundamentals of Performance Technology offers a brief overview of each major component of a Human Performance Technology Model that addresses diagnosing workplace situations, identifying causes, selecting appropriate interventions, implementing change, and evaluating results. The second edition contains two new appendices that describe the ISPI developed Standards of Performance of Technology and map the content of Fundamentals of Performance Technology and Performance Improvement Interventions to those Standards.  Performance technology as a means to improve organizational and individual performance is often shroud in complex language, rarefied theory, and bewildering applications. Several excellent publications either elucidate Performance Technology’s whys and whats or make clear its many hows, but few adequately and comprehensively clarify both.   Authors Darlene Van Tiem of University of Michigan, James Moseley of Wayne State University, and Joan Conway Dessinger of the Lake Group have recently developed the second edition of Fundamentals of Performance Technology: A Guide to Improving People, Process, and Performance. This guidebook broadly explains performance technology as an established, systematic, and reproducible method of improving organizational and individual performance (the HPT Model). It also provides applications of performance technology at work in a variety of environments, and proffers dozens of performance tools to help the reader improve his or her own performance technology practice.   So what is Performance Technology? According to the authors, performance technology is the systematic process of linking business goals and strategies with the workforce responsible for achieving goals. Moreover, performance technology practitioners study and design processes that bring about increased performance in the workplace using a common methodology to understand, inspire, and improve. And, finally, performance technology systematically analyzes performance problems and their underlying causes and describes exemplary performance and success indicators.  Van Tiem et al have authored a guidebook that makes performance technology understandable and achievable by assembling an easy-to-read, easy-to-apply, and comprehensive explanation of the factors affecting workplace behavior and using a commonsense approach and consistent structure.  In Fundamentals of Performance Technology, the authors offer a brief overview of each major component of the HPT Model, its theoretical underpinnings, and major thinkers, covering:   diagnosing workplace situations   identifying causes   selecting doable, adequate interventions   implementing changes, and  evaluating results    In addition, each of these sections is complemented by: Illustrative real-life Case Studies showing practical applications from a variety of workplace environments; and   Job Aids -- or performance support tools -- to help the reader bring about real workplace performance improvement. Fully indexed and featuring a glossary of performance technology terms, an extensive bibliography and selected readings, and dozens of reproducible performance tools, Fundamentals of Performance Technology not only simplifies the practice of Performance Technology, it shows you how it has worked and how to do it.    The Second Edition contains two new appendices that describe the ISPI developed Standards of Performance of Technology and map the content of Fundamentals of Performance Technology and Performance Improvement Interventions to those Standards.},

  abstract = {In contemporary query languages, the user is responsible for navigation among semantically related data. Because of the huge amount of data and the complex structural relationships among data in modern applications, it is unrealistic to suppose that the user could know completely the content and structure of the available information. There are several query languages whose purpose is to facilitate navigation in unknown structures of databases. However, the background assumption of these languages is that the user knows how data are related to each other semantically in the structure at hand. So far only little attention has been paid to how unknown semantic associations among available data can be discovered. We address this problem in this article. A semantic association between two entities can be constructed if a sequence of relationships expressed explicitly in a database can be found that connects these entities to each other. This sequence may contain several other entities through which the original entities are connected to each other indirectly. We introduce an expressive and declarative query language for discovering semantic associations. Our query language is able, for example, to discover semantic associations between entities for which only some of the characteristics are known. Further, it integrates the manipulation of semantic associations with the manipulation of documents that may contain information on entities in semantic associations.},

In the end, the public browsed the remnants of the machine for souvenirs to take home. This hommage to the energy of a city that keeps rebuilding itself time after time is a wonderful example of the different and sometimes conflicting conceptions of artists and engineers on how machines should work–and as such an early collaborative effort that foreshadowed the events staged by E.A.T.—as well as a document on the 60s with the rise of happening and performance.

Centered on the unique artistic strategies of reimagining life forms, this paper analyzes and compares a selection of generative software-based projects, in which artists are mimicking different natural phenomena and have the tendency to beautify nature and life, with bio art projects, where ethical considerations are prioritized over other aspects of the work. Experimenting with software and producing code-based generative art can be a relatively accessible creative endeavor while working with synthetic biology requires more demanding and controlled workplace conditions and specialized equipment. Despite the differences in accessibility and usability, both fields of generative and bio art challenge the boundaries of contemporary artistic practice and research by mapping, provoking and contemplating the dramatic changes of life forms, in the era when living matter can be re-engineered into a new material capable of computing.},

J.R.R. 톨킨의 대표작으로 『호빗』과 『반지의 제왕』이 가장 널리 알려져 있지만, 사실 이들은 톨킨의 ‘가운데땅 신화’ 중 일부에 불과하다. 톨킨의 가운데땅 신화는 20세기와 21세기에 걸쳐 소설, 영화, 게임, 음악 등 문화 전반을 아우르는 판타지의 기원이자 시작이 되고 있으며, 현대 문화를 이해하는 고전이자 걸작의 반열에 올라 있다. 그리고 『실마릴리온』과 『끝나지 않은 이야기』는 그중에서도 톨킨의 세계관을 이해하는 핵심적인 책들이다. 『호빗』과『반지의 제왕』을 읽은 독자들은 이제 톨킨의 가운데땅 여정을 막 시작했다고 할 수 있을 것이다. 두 작품에는 설명되지 않고 모호하게 남아있는 것들이 꽤 많다. 대체 엘베레스와 에아렌딜은 누구인지, 곤돌린은 어디에 있는지, 요정은 왜 ‘서녘’이라는 곳으로 떠나려 하는지, 아라고른의 선조라는 ‘서쪽나라 사람들’은 누구인지 등, 숱한 의문들이 곳곳에 남아있다. 이것은 『호빗』과『반지의 제왕』너머에 엄청난 이야기가 숨어있다는 것을 알게 해 준다. 그리고 그 ‘엄청난 이야기’를 가장 핵심적으로 담고 있는 것이 바로 『실마릴리온』과 『끝나지 않은 이야기』이다. 『실마릴리온』은 세상의 창조부터 『반지의 제왕』까지 이어지는 이야기들의 모음집이다. 수많은 이름과 지명이 등장하는 이 이야기의 규모는 실로 어마어마하다. 처음에는 신들의 기원과 구성에 관한 이야기가 자리하며, 그 후 실마릴을 뒤쫓아 축복받은 땅을 떠난 요정들의 이야기 「퀜타 실마릴리온」이 이어진다. 실마릴을 둘러싼 대모험과 비극이 벌어진 뒤 에아렌딜의 구원 요청을 받아들인 발라들의 반격으로 마침내 대적 모르고스는 파멸하고 결국 실마릴은 하늘과 땅과 바다로 흩어진다. 「아칼라베스」와 「힘의 반지와 제3시대」에서는 누메노르의 몰락으로 가운데땅에 돌아온 서쪽나라 누메노르 사람들의 이야기와 가운데땅을 떠나기 싫어했던 요정들, 그리고 그 사이에서 재기를 꿈꾸는 사우론이 등장한다. 신들이 누리는 영생을 탐하다 사우론의 간계에 빠져 모든 것을 잃어버린 누메노르인들의 이야기는 흡사 한 편의 그리스 비극을 보는 듯하다. 만족할 줄 모르고 계속되는 욕심에 의해 파멸하는 인간들의 모습을 보고 있자면 톨킨이 『반지의 제왕』에서 강조했던, 작고 소중한 것들의 중요성을 새삼 깨닫게 된다. 이어지는 「힘의 반지와 제3시대」에서는 「아칼라베스」에서 살아남아 가운데땅으로 돌아온 사우론과 요정들의 대결이 벌어진다. 침몰에서 살아남아 가운데땅에 도착한 엘렌딜과 그의 아들들은 누메노르인들의 왕국을 세우고 요정들과 연합해 마침내 사우론을 패퇴시킨다. 그러나 사우론의 반지를 탈취한 이실두르는 반지의 유혹을 거부하지 못하고 자신이 그것을 차지한다. 이것이 바로 『반지의 제왕』 영화의 서막에서 등장하는 장면이다. 그 이후 프로도가 등장해 반지를 파괴하고 요정들이 퇴장하면서, 기나긴 이야기의 막이 내린다. 『실마릴리온』은 이처럼 톨킨이 만든 세상의 역사를 총망라한 책이다.『호빗』과『반지의 제왕』을 재미있게 읽은 독자라면, 또 『호빗』과『반지의 제왕』의 숱하게 남은 의문들이 궁금한 독자라면, 반드시 읽어야 할 책이다.      ◎ 책 속으로  유일자 에루가 있었고, 아르다에서는 그를 일루바타르로 칭한다. 그는 처음에 ‘거룩한 자’, 곧 아이누들을 만들었고, 그의 생각의 소산인 이들은 다른 것들이 만들어지기 전에 그와 함께 있었다. 그는 그들에게 음악의 주제를 주었고, 그들은 그의 앞에서 노래를 불러 그를 기쁘게 하였다. 하지만 오랫동안 그들은 혼자서만 노래하거나 혹은 극히 소수만 모여서 노래를 하고 나머지는 듣기만 하였다. 그들은 각각 일루바타르의 생각 중에서 자신의 기원(起源)이 된 부분만 이해하였고, 형제들에 대한 이해는 느렸다. 하지만 계속해서 노래를 듣는 중에 그들은 좀 더 깊이 이해하게 되었고 제창과 화음이 향상되었다.  (실마릴리온 〈아이눌린달레〉 43쪽)  만웨와 멜코르는 일루바타르의 생각 속에서 형제였다. 세상으로 들어온 아이누 중에서 가장 강한 자는 본래의 멜코르였다. 하지만 일루바타르의 사랑을 가장 많이 받고, 또 그의 목적을 가장 확실하게 이해한 자는 만웨였다. 그는 때가 이르면 최초의 왕, 곧 아르다의 군주이자 그곳에 사는 모든 이들의 지배자가 되기로 정해져 있었다. 아르다에서 그의 기쁨은 바람과 구름에 있었고, 또한 아득히 높은 곳에서부터 저 깊은 곳까지, ‘아르다의 장막’ 맨 바깥의 경계에서부터 풀밭에 부는 산들바람에 이르기까지 대기의 모든 영역에 있었다. 그는 술리모란 별명을 가지고 있는데, ‘아르다의 호흡을 관장하는 이’란 뜻이다. 날개가 튼튼하고 빨리 나는 모든 새들을 그는 사랑하고 이들은 그의 명령에 따라 오고 간다.  (실마릴리온 〈발라퀜타〉 58쪽)  바로 그 시간, 먹구름의 그림자가 바람을 타고 햇빛 환한 대지 위로 날아가듯이, 멜코르와 웅골리안트는 발리노르의 들판 위로 서둘러 달려와 푸른 둔덕 에젤로하르 앞에 당도하였다. 이때 웅골리안트의 장막이 커지면서 두 나무의 뿌리까지 뒤덮었고, 멜코르는 둔덕 위로 뛰어 올라갔다. 그는 자신의 검은 창으로 두 나무의 고갱이까지 찔러 깊은 상처를 냈고, 나무에서는 마치 피가 흐르듯 수액이 쏟아져 나와 땅바닥을 뒤덮었다. 그러자 웅골리안트가 그것을 빨아먹었고, 그녀는 두 나무를 옮겨 다니며 나무의 상처에 자신의 거무튀튀한 주둥이를 들이밀어 나무의 수액을 완전히 고갈시켜 버렸다. 웅골리안트 속에 있던 죽음의 독이 나무의 조직 속으로 스며들어 조직과 뿌리, 가지, 잎까지 시들게 했고, 나무는 죽고 말았다. 하지만 여전히 갈증을 느낀 웅골리안트는 바르다의 우물로 가서 우물물을 모두 들이마셨다. 웅골리안트는 물을 마시면서 검은 증기를 뿜어냈고, 거대하고 무시무시한 형체로 부풀어 올라 멜코르마저 두려움에 떨었다.  (실마릴리온 〈발리노르의 어두워짐〉 134\textasciitilde 135쪽)  그날 밤 그는 놀도르 앞에서 그들이 영원토록 잊지 못할 연설을 했다. 그의 웅변은 격렬하면서도 사나웠고, 분노와 오만으로 가득 차 있었다. 연설을 듣던 놀도르 요정들은 미칠 듯이 흥분했다. 그의 분노와 증오는 모두 모르고스를 향한 것이었지만, 그가 말한 내용은 거의 모두 모르고스가 말한 거짓말을 그대로 따온 것이었다. 하지만 그는 부친의 피살로 인한 슬픔과 실마릴의 강탈로 인한 고통 때문에 광기에 사로잡혀 있었다. 그는 이제 핀웨가 죽었기 때문에 자신이 모든 놀도르의 왕 이라고 선포하고 발라들의 포고를 조롱하였다.  (실마릴리온 〈놀도르의 탈출〉 144쪽)  어느 가을날 저녁, 펠라군드와 베렌은 열 명의 일행과 함께 나르고스론드를 출발하였다. 그들은 나로그강을 따라 올라가 이브린폭포 근처에 있는 강의 발원지에 이르렀다. 어둠산맥 밑에서 그들은 오르크 무리를 만났으나, 야음을 틈타 그들의 야영지를 습격하여 그들을 모두 베어 죽이고 그들의 복장과 무기를 탈취하였다. 펠라군드의 솜씨로 그들은 외양과 얼굴을 오르크들처럼 변장하였다. 이렇게 변장을 한 그들은 북쪽 길을 따라 한참 올라간 다음, 에레드 웨스린과 타우르누푸인 산지 사이의 서부 통로로 대담하게 들어갔다. 성채에 있던 사우론이 그들을 목격하고 수상하게 여겼다. 왜냐하면 그들은 서둘러 행군을 하고 있었던 데다, 그 길을 지나는 모르고스의 모든 부하들은 반드시 보고를 해야 하지만 그들은 그렇게 하지 않았기 때문이다. 그래서 그는 그들을 붙잡아서 자기 앞에 데려오도록 했다. 그리하여 저 유명한 사우론과 펠라군드의 싸움이 벌어졌다. 펠라군드는 힘의 노래들로 사우론과 겨루었고, 왕의 힘은 대단했다. 하지만 결국 사우론이 승리를 거두었고, 그 이야기는 「레이시안의 노래」에 전해진다.  (실마릴리온 〈베렌과 루시엔〉 278쪽)  서녘의 군대와 북부 세력의 회전(會戰)은 대전투 혹은 ‘분노의 전쟁’으로 명명되었다. 모르고스 휘하의 모든 군대가 참전하였고, 그들의 수는 셀 수조차 없이 많아서 안파우글리스를 덮고도 남을 정도였으며, 북부의 온 땅이 전화에 휩싸였다. 그러나 그래도 아무 소용이 없었다. 발로그들은 궤멸되었고 극소수만이 달아나 접근이 불가능한 지하의 깊은 동굴 속에 숨었다. 무수한 오르크 군단은 거대한 화염 속의 밀짚처럼 사라졌고, 불바람 앞에 오그라드는 낙엽처럼 흩날렸다. 먼 훗날까지 살아남아 세상을 괴롭힌 오르크는 얼마 되지 않았다. 인간의 조상인 ‘요정의 친구들’에 속하는 세 가문 중에서 살아남아 있던 소수의 인간들은 발라들 편에 서서 전쟁을 하였다. 그때서야 그들은 바라군드와 바라히르, 갈도르와 군도르, 후오르와 후린 및 그들의 다른 많은 군주들의 원수를 갚았다.  (실마릴리온 〈에아렌딜의 항해와 분노의 전쟁〉 404쪽)  오랫동안 누메노르인들은 자신들이 번영을 누리고 있다고 생각하였고, 혹시 더 행복해지지는 않았더라도 더 강해졌으며, 부자들은 더 부유해졌다는 느낌을 가졌다. 그들은 사우론의 도움과 조언으로 재산을 더 늘렸고, 기관(機關)을 고안하여 훨씬 더 큰 함선을 만들었던 것이다. 그래서 그들은 이제 힘을 과시하며 병기를 싣고 가운데땅으로 항해를 떠났다. 그들은 더 이상 선물을 주는 자나 통치자가 아니라, 전쟁에 미친 사나운 인간들일 뿐이었다. 그들은 가운데땅의 인간들을 사냥하여 가진 것을 빼앗고 노예로 삼았으며, 많은 이들을 자신들의 제단 위에서 잔인하게 살해하였다. 그 당시에 그들은 자신들의 요새 안에 신전과 함께 커다란 무덤을 만들어 두었던 것이다. 인간들은 그들을 두려워하였고, 옛날의 자상한 왕들에 대한 기억은 세상에서 차츰 희미해지면서 가공스런 많은 이야기에 묻혀 버렸다.  (실마릴리온 〈아칼라베스〉 436쪽)  사우론은 남아 있는 힘의 반지를 모두 손에 넣었다. 그리고 그것들을 가운데땅의 다른 종족들에게 나누어 주고, 자기 종족의 한계 이상의 비밀스런 힘을 원하는 이들을 자신의 지배하에 두려고 했다. 그는 난쟁이들에게는 일곱 개의 반지를 주었다. 하지만 인간들에게는 아홉 개의 반지를 주게 되는데, 다른 경우와 마찬가지로 인간들은 이때도 가장 쉽게 그의 뜻을 따랐던 것이다. 그는 그 반지들의 제작 과정에 참여하였기 때문에, 자신이 지배하는 모든 반지를 더욱 쉽게 악용할 수 있었다. 그리하여 반지는 저주받은 존재가 되었고 종국에는 반지를 사용하는 모든 이들을 배반하였다.  (실마릴리온 〈힘의 반지와 제3시대〉 456\textasciitilde 457쪽)},

  abstract = {Cities are growing faster than at any time in history, straining services and infrastructure. Technology-driven advances are at the forefront of solving this age-old problem           Click here to subscribe to The Economist on YouTube: http://econ.trib.al/rWl91R7 By 2050, two thirds of the world’s population will live in cities. Urbanisation is happening faster than at any time in human history. Globally, 900 million people are living in slums. Cities can’t add housing fast enough. Today, an estimated one billion vehicles are already bringing urban areas to a standstill. Cities consume three-quarters of the world’s energy each year and are responsible for around 50\% of greenhouse gas emissions.  These are challenges our cities have been facing for decades.    But now some city leaders, businesses, and even citizens, are taking new approaches to tackling these old problems. They’re transforming their cities with technology.  In Seoul, the use of data is seen as the key to tackling some of the big challenges of city life - like moving its people around. City workers here use sophisticated technology to understand and transform how the city - and its metro - can be run. The subway system transports 7 million people every day. It’s widely regarded as one of the best in the world. And the entire network from wheels to workers is driven by data.  The speed and frequency of the trains can be constantly adjusted to keep everything running smoothly. “Smart” cameras measure how many passengers are boarding - and how quickly and sensors on the trains and tracks monitor every last component to provide early warnings when maintenance is required and prevent a costly breakdown.  They use smartphone apps, social media and the web to give citizens real-time alerts and alternative routes - and keep this megacity running smoothly. Transport is just the start. Seoul’s city planners are using data to better understand more of the big challenges this fast-growing city faces, from air pollution to affordable housing.  There are an estimated 30,000 start-ups in South Korea - many of which are offering innovative solutions to challenges like the city’s housing shortages.  One company uses this open-source data to pair up young people looking for accommodation with older citizens who have rooms to spare. It’s a tiny offshoot of an industry that is growing rapidly in cities across the world. By 2020, this so-called “smart city” industry will be worth an estimated \$1.5 trillion dollars. There’ll be investment in everything from networks and sensors to new apps and services, from the world’s biggest technology firms, to innovative new startups working from someone’s front room. This is the headquarters of FLARE, a start-up based in Kenya. Its young entrepreneurs are working with real-time data sourced from that most ubiquitous of modern innovations:  the smartphone. Kenya’s capital, Nairobi is emerging as a vibrant tech hub. It is also one of the fastest growing cities in the world. Home to 4.2 million people, it’s more than doubled its population in the last 20 years.  As in many cities in developing countries the ageing, inadequate infrastructure is struggling to cope. The problem isn't a shortage of ambulances - Nairobi has 150 of them - double the number needed in an average city. But the city has no centralized emergency service to coordinate them.  Residents here are faced with 50 different numbers to call for help - and no guarantee when - or whether - their ambulance will arrive.  The app aims to do the job of a centralized emergency service, compiling real-time data to coordinate and connect patients in need, available ambulances and the right hospitals or healthcare providers. Across the developing world, innovators are increasingly exploiting existing technology to help citizens cope with their cities’ overstretched infrastructure.  In America, innovators are also looking ahead to the next wave - anticipating data-driven technologies that could help predict problems before they even happen. Boston, Massachusetts, is the 10th largest metropolitan area in America. It’s home to 4.8 million residents. And while Boston may be one of the oldest urban settlements in this country it’s fast developing world leading technology that could help shape the cities of the future. This is the mission of MIT’s Senseable City Lab - to anticipate the impact of technology on urban life and use it to transform the way cities are run.},

  abstract = {[Long overshadowed by Japan and China, South Korea is a small country that happens to be one of the great national success stories of the postwar period. From a failed state with no democratic tradition, ruined and partitioned by war, and sapped by a half-century of colonial rule, South Korea transformed itself in just fifty years into an economic powerhouse and a democracy that serves as a model for other countries. With no natural resources and a tradition of authoritarian rule, Korea managed to accomplish a second Asian miracle.Daniel Tudor is a journalist who has lived in and written about Korea for almost a decade. In Korea: The Impossible Country, Tudor examines Korea's cultural foundations; the Korean character; the public sphere in politics, business, and the workplace as well as the family, dating, and marriage. In doing so, he touches on topics as diverse as shamanism, clan-ism, the dilemma posed by North Korea, the myths about doing business in Korea, the Koreans' renowned hard-partying ethos, and why the infatuation with learning English is now causing huge social problems.]South Korea has undergone two miracles at once: economic development and complete democratization. The question now is, will it become as some see Japan, a rich yet aging society, devoid of energy and momentum? Or will the dynamism of Korean society and its willingness to change—as well as the opportunity it has now to welcome outsiders into its fold—enable it to experience a third miracle that will propel it into the ranks of the world’s leading nations in terms of human culture, democracy, and wealth?},

  abstract = {"This is a book about science, technology, and love," writes Sherry Turkle. In it, we learn how a love for science can start with a love for an object—a microscope, a modem, a mud pie, a pair of dice, a fishing rod. Objects fire imagination and set young people on a path to a career in science. In this collection, distinguished scientists, engineers, and designers as well as twenty-five years of MIT students describe how objects encountered in childhood became part of the fabric of their scientific selves. In two major essays that frame the collection, Turkle tells a story of inspiration and connection through objects that is often neglected in standard science education and in our preoccupation with the virtual.The senior scientists' essays trace the arc of a life: the gears of a toy car introduce the chain of cause and effect to artificial intelligence pioneer Seymour Papert; microscopes disclose the mystery of how things work to MIT President and neuroanatomist Susan Hockfield; architect Moshe Safdie describes how his boyhood fascination with steps, terraces, and the wax hexagons of beehives lead him to a life immersed in the complexities of design. The student essays tell stories that echo these narratives: plastic eggs in an Easter basket reveal the power of centripetal force; experiments with baking illuminate the geology of planets; LEGO bricks model worlds, carefully engineered and colonized.All of these voices—students and mentors—testify to the power of objects to awaken and inform young scientific minds. This is a truth that is simple, intuitive, and easily overlooked.Introductory and concluding essays by: Sherry Turkle.Mentor essays by: Susan Hockfield, Donald Ingber, Alan Kay, Sarah Kuhn, Donald Norman, Seymour Papert, Rosalind Picard, Moshe Safdie.},

  abstract = {Renowned media scholar Sherry Turkle investigates how a flight from conversation undermines our relationships, creativity, and productivity—and why reclaiming face-to-face conversation can help us regain lost ground.We live in a technological universe in which we are always communicating. And yet we have sacrificed conversation for mere connection. ~ Preeminent author and researcher Sherry Turkle has been studying digital culture for over thirty years. Long an enthusiast for its possibilities, here she investigates a troubling consequence: at work, at home, in politics, and in love, we find ways around conversation, tempted by the possibilities of a text or an email in which we don’t have to look, listen, or reveal ourselves.  ~ We develop a taste for what mere connection offers. The dinner table falls silent as children compete with phones for their parents’ attention. Friends learn strategies to keep conversations going when only a few people are looking up from their phones. At work, we retreat to our screens although it is conversation at the water cooler that increases not only productivity but commitment to work. Online, we only want to share opinions that our followers will agree with – a politics that shies away from the real conflicts and solutions of the public square.  ~ The case for conversation begins with the necessary conversations of solitude and self-reflection. They are endangered: these days, always connected, we see loneliness as a problem that technology should solve. Afraid of being alone, we rely on other people to give us a sense of ourselves, and our capacity for empathy and relationship suffers. We see the costs of the flight from conversation everywhere: conversation is the cornerstone for democracy and in business it is good for the bottom line. In the private sphere, it builds empathy, friendship, love, learning, and productivity. ~ But there is good news: we are resilient. Conversation cures.  ~ Based on five years of research and interviews in homes, schools, and the workplace, Turkle argues that we have come to a better understanding of where our technology can and cannot take us and that the time is right to reclaim conversation. The most human—and humanizing—thing that we do.  ~ The virtues of person-to-person conversation are timeless, and our most basic technology, talk, responds to our modern challenges. We have everything we need to start, we have each other.},

Multimodal human–computer interaction has sought for decades to endow computers with similar capabilities, in order to provide more natural, powerful, and compelling interactive experiences. With the rapid advance in non-desktop computing generated by powerful mobile devices and affordable sensors in recent years, multimodal research that leverages speech, touch, vision, and gesture is on the rise. This paper provides a brief and personal review of some of the key aspects and issues in multimodal interaction, touching on the history, opportunities, and challenges of the area, especially in the area of multimodal integration. We review the question of early vs. late integration and find inspiration in recent evidence in biological sensory integration. Finally, we list challenges that lie ahead for research in multimodal human–computer interaction.},

Presented 35 years ago and still paradigmatic for the ever-shifting boundaries between art, technology, commerce and entertainment, Cybernetic Serendipity epitomizes some of the complicated dynamics that delineate the gamut of media art today.},

The authors approach musical meaning in specific case studies against the background of general trends of cultural globalization and the construction/deconstruction of identity produced by human (and artificial) voices. The essays proceed from different angles, notably sociocultural and historical contexts, philosophical and literary aesthetics, vocal technique, analysis of vocal microstructures, text/phonetics-music-relationships, historical vocal sources or models for contemporary art and pop music, and areas of conflict between vocalization, "ethnicity," and cultural identity. They pinpoint crucial topical features that have shaped identity-discourses in art and popular musical situations since the1950s, with a special focus on the past two decades. The volume thus offers a unique compilation of texts on the human voice in a period of heightened cultural globalization by utilizing systematic methodological research and firsthand accounts on compositional practice by current Asian and Western authors.},

In spite of their professed utilitarianism, however, most avant-gardists created works that can hardly be regarded as practical instruments of societal transformation. Exploring this paradox, Vaingurt claims that the artists’ investment of technology with aesthetics prevented their creations from being fully conscripted into the arsenal of political hegemony. The purposes of avant-garde technologies, she contends, are contemplative rather than constructive. Looking at Meyerhold’s theater, Tatlin’s and Khlebnikov’s architectural designs, Mayakovsky’s writings, and other works from the period, Vaingurt offers an innovative reading of an exceptionally complex moment in the formation of Soviet culture.},

Väliaho investigates the role screen media play in the networks that today harness human minds and bodies -- the ways that images animated on console game platforms, virtual reality technologies, and computer screens capture human potential by plugging it into arrangements of finance, war, and the consumption of entertainment. Drawing on current neuroscience and political and economic thought, Väliaho argues that these images work to shape the atomistic individuals who populate the neoliberal world of accumulation and war.Väliaho bases his argument on a broad notion of the image as something both visible and sayable, detectable in various screen platforms but also in scientific perception and theoretical ideas. After laying out the conceptual foundations of the book, Väliaho offers focused and detailed investigations of the current visual economy. He considers the imagery of first-person shooter video games as tools of "neuropower"; explores the design and construction of virtual reality technologies to treat post-traumatic stress disorder in veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan; and examines three instances of video installation art that have the power to disrupt the dominant regime of sensibility rather than reinforce it.},

  abstract = {Despite the relevance of new media art for the critical understanding of the information and network societies today, it is largely ignored as a socially engaged practice—certainly compared to other forms of socially engaged artistic practices in the international field of contemporary art. This article outlines the reasons for this relative neglect and specifies different kinds of new media art that qualify for the category of socially engaged art beyond leftist politics and ideologies transposed to the realm of art. Proposing and mobilizing a “media-reflexive” art theory, which emerged from the author’s doctoral dissertation, this claim is substantiated by the analysis of three exemplary digital art projects by Joseph Nechvatal, George Legrady and Blast Theory, respectively.},

  abstract = {Twentieth-century art history is not just a history of individuals, but of collectives, groups. Universities and colleges have had much to do with this through their support of artistic communities and creative interactions. In the 1920s and 1930s, the Bauhaus was known for this. In the 1940s, Black Mountain College became a leader in community-based visual art practice and education. And in the 1970s and 1980s, the Department of Media Study at the State University of New York at Buffalo was the place to be. It was there, in 1973, well before any other university had a program explicitly devoted to media art, that Gerald O'Grady founded a media study program that is now legendary. Artists--including avant-garde filmmakers Hollis Frampton, Tony Conrad, and Paul Sharits, documentary maker James Blue, video artists Woody Vasulka and Steina, and Viennese action artist Peter Weibel--investigated, taught, and made media art in all forms, and founded the first Digital Arts Laboratory. These Buffalo faculty members were not just practicing artists, but also theorists who wrote and spoke on issues raised by their work. They set the terms for the development of media art and paved the way for the triumph of video installation art in the 1990s. The images and texts in Buffalo Heads bear witness to the groundbreaking events at the Buffalo Center for Media Study. The book presents not just a tribute to a famous media department finally receiving its due; it is a rich inventory of primary texts (many never before published), works that will improve our understanding of media, amplify our cultural memory, and offer a perspective on contemporary issues.Woody Vasulka was a Professor at the Center for Media Study at SUNY Buffalo from 1973 to 1979. With his wife Steina, he founded The Kitchen, a New York City electronic media theater in 1971. Peter Weibel is an artist, curator, and author. He is Director of ZKM  Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe and a coeditor of other ZKM/MIT Press publications, including Making Things Public: Atmospheres of Democracy (2005) and ICONOCLASH: Beyond the Image Wars in Science, Religion, and Art (2002).},

  title = {The {{Correspondence}} of {{René Descartes}} 1643},
  author = {Verbeek, Theodoricus Hendrikus Maria and Bos, Erik-Jan and van de Ven, Jeroen},
  year = 2003,
  publisher = {Zeno Institute for Philosophy},
  abstract = {There is little disagreement that the standard edition of Descartes by Charles Adam and Paul Tannery (1897-1913, known as AT) should be redone, in any case as far as the correspondence is concerned. The reason is not only that its chronology is defective and that in its latest reprint the edition is difficult to handle even for expert readers, but also that, after more than hundred years, the problems raised by the correspondence deserve a fresh examination. The aim of the present publication was to thoroughly test the format we had in mind for a new and critical edition of Descartes’ complete correspondence. This comprised, not only the edition properly speaking - text, apparatus, identification of quotations, persons and events, etc - but also a calendar of Descartes’ life, based on documentary evidence rather than the biography of Adrien Baillet (1691), as well as a biographical dictionary of correspondents and persons mentioned in the letters. More particularly we aimed at providing an annotation which, without being overwhelming and as a result redundant, was historically and scientifically informative - an ideal which is far from being reached in AT. We choose the year 1643 because it is fairly representative of the correspondence as a whole. It contains letters in French, Latin and even Dutch. The material includes autographs, copies and abstracts as well as minutes published by Clerselier. The contents cover a large spectrum of interests: personal and legal business, polemics, mathematics, physics, etc. It was the year in which Descartes’ controversy with the Utrecht theologians reached its most violent and most public phase with the publication of the Letter to Voetius and the start of legal procedures but also the year in which Descartes started his correspondence with Princess Elizabeth and virtually completed the Principia (1644). Apart from the presentation, which in our view is more clear than it ever was in one of the older editions, what is new in this volume? Here we will point out some highlights (for a more complete overview, see pp. xxvii-xxxi). For the letters of Princess Elizabeth we retrieved and re-examined the only surviving copy, formerly in the possession of the Van Pallandt family, now in the custody of the Stichting Vrienden der Geldersche Kasteelen (Arnhem). Other copies of letters belonging to that correspondence were found in the British Library and the Royal Library in The Hague - they not only provided a better text than Clerselier but also allowed us to redate one of the letters (now dated 29 November 1643). We found the autograph of a letter to Mersenne (2 February 1643), which had not been seen by the editors of AT (nor for that matter by the editors of the Correspondance de Mersenne). An autograph letter to Huygens (10 July 1643), which was believed to be lost since its publication by Foucher de Careil, turned out to be kept in the Waller Collection in Sweden (Uppsala). For a letter to Van Buijtendijck we found a new textual basis in a work by Tobias Andreae of 1653 (Methodi Cartesiani Assertio). We believe we provided a set of notes and commentaries that are much clearer than whatever can be found in any of the existing editions. The mathematical problem discussed in letters to Pollot and Elizabeth is expertly illuminated and clarified by Henk Bos and the various mechanical and physical problems are explained by Carla Rita Palmerino. For incidents that spill over into many other letters we decided to provide a synthesis at the end of the book - for 1643 there are three of such appendices: 1) on the ‘Utrecht Crisis’; 2) on the Illustrious Brotherhood of Our Blessed Lady in ’s-Hertogenbosch (Bois-le-Duc), which is the subject of Pt VI of Descartes’ Letter to Voetius (1643); 3) the Problem of Apollonius or ‘Problem of the three circles’, which is discussed in the correspondence of Descartes and Elizabeth. A calendar, based on a fresh exploration of the sources, and an extensive biographical lexicon complete the volume.},

  abstract = {Arnheim, Gestalt and Art is the first book-length discussion of the powerful thinking of the psychologist of art, Rudolf Arnheim. Written as a complete overview of Arnheim's thinking, it covers fundamental issues of the importance of psychological discussion of the arts, the status of gestalt psychology, the various sense modalities and media, and developmental issues. By proceeding in a direction from general to specific and then proceeding through dynamic processes as they unfold in time (creativity, development, etc.), the book discovers an unappreciated unity to Arnheim's thinking. Not content to simply summarize Arnheim's theory, however, Arnheim, Art, and Gestalt goes on to enrich (and occasionally question) Arnheim's findings with the contemporary results of gestalt-theoretical research from around the world, but especially in Italy and Germany. The result is a workable overview of the psychology of art with bridges built to contemporary research, making Arnheim's approach living and sustainable.},

Virilio imagines a coming world of interactive, informational networks offering a prison-house of illusionary transcendence. He pictures global terrorism (perpetrated by and against technological states) filling up the surreal void of an abandoned real. In a multidisciplinary excavation of contemporary physics, architecture, esthetic theory, and sociology, Virilio traces the dystopic unity of the contemporary Western predicament with lightning prescience and clarity.},

Perhaps inside that fugitive anxiety, that shudder that seizes the minds of those who, just returning from a long vacation, contemplate the imminent encounter with mounds of unwanted mail or with a house that's been broken into and emptied of its contents. It begins with the urge to flee and escape for a second from an oppressive technological environment, to regain one's senses and one's sense of self."--from  Lost DimensionOriginally written in French in 1983, Lost Dimension remains a cornerstone book in the work of Paul Virilio: the one most closely tied to his background as an urban planner and architect, and the one that most clearly anticipates the technologically wired urban space we live in today: a city of permanent transit and internalized borders, where time has overtaken space, and where telecommunications has replaced both our living and our working environments. We are living in the realm of the lost dimension, where the three-dimensional public square of our urban past has collapsed into the two-dimensional interface of the various screens that function as gateways to home, office, and public spaces, be they the flat-screen televisions on our walls, the computer screens on our desktops, or the smartphones in our pockets.In this multidisciplinary tapestry of contemporary physics, architecture, aesthetic theory, and sociology, Virilio describes the effects of today's hyperreality on our understanding of space. Having long since passed the opposition of city and country, and city and suburb, the speed-ridden city and space of today are an opposition between the nomadic and the sedentary: a web of interactive, informational networks that turn our world into a prison-house of illusory transcendence.},

A biting meditation on Progress technoscientific progress, at any cost and without any limits this book defines the ways in which postindustrial science has merged with out-and-out hyperterrorism to threaten the foundations of Greco-Roman, Judeo-Christian civilization, and the future of the planet with them, through innovation of mass catastrophes that are part and parcel of its panoply of inventions.    Urging us to face up to the consequences of our brave-new-world technologies, Virilio calls for the creation of a Museum of the Accident to fight our habituation to horror and violence, and our daily overexposure to terror, in the name, not of some preventive war, but of a preventive intelligence that would help us deal with both natural and artificial disasters.},

In case of total war, between the native populations which form the constitutional basis of all great modern states and the military now in charge of defending them there was no more "common culture." Industrial wars subsequently managed to replace the thousand-year-old pact of semi-colonization with total colonization. First experimented with in South America, this kind of "endo-colonization" (the military cracking down on its own population) was gradually extended to all the post-industrial countries through the exponential development of the techno-military complex.},

Building on the works of Morand, Marinetti, and McLuhan, Virilio presents a vision more radically political than that of any of his French contemporaries: speed as the engine of destruction. Speed and Politics presents a topological account of the entire history of humanity, honing in on the technological advances made possible through the militarization of society. Paralleling Heidegger's account of technology, Virilio's vision sees speed--not class or wealth--as the primary force shaping civilization. In this "technical vitalism," multiple projectiles--inert fortresses and bunkers, the "metabolic bodies" of soldiers, transport vessels, and now information and computer technology--are launched in a permanent assault on the world and on human nature. Written at a lightning-fast pace, Virilio's landmark book is a split-second, overwhelming look at how humanity's motivity has shaped the way we function today, and what might come of it.},

Tearing aside the veil of hypocrisy in which the USA and its allies wrapped the war, Virillo demonstrates that the nature of the bombing was set by strategic rather than ethical considerations.Beneath the humanitarian rhetoric, Virillo sees a sinister innovation in the methods of waging war: territorial space is being replaced by orbital space in which a system of global telesurveillance is linked to the destructive power of bombers and missiles. Governments, the military and the media are becoming part of a seamless and self-justifying process linked by new information and arms technologies.Passionate and political, Strategy of Deception is a vital examination not only of the war in Yugoslavia but also what Virillo calls our “fin-de-siécle infantilization” in which the reality of battle is reduced to flickering images on a screen.},

  abstract = {In Does Capitalism Have a Future?, a global quintet of distinguished scholars cut their way through to the question of whether our capitalist system can survive in the medium run. Despite the current gloom, conventional wisdom still assumes that there is no real alternative to capitalism. The authors argue that this generalization is a mistaken outgrowth of the optimistic nineteenth-century claim that human history ascends through stages to an enlightened equilibrium of liberal capitalism. All major historical systems have broken down in the end, and in the modern epoch several cataclysmic events-notably the French revolution, World War I, and the collapse of the Soviet bloc-came to pass when contemporary political elites failed to calculate the consequences of the processes they presumed to govern. At present, none of our governing elites and very few intellectuals can fathom a systemic collapse in the coming decades. While the book's contributors arrive at different conclusions, they are in constant dialogue with one another, and they construct a relatively seamless-if open-ended-whole. Written by five of world's most respected scholars of global historical trends, this ambitious book asks the most important of questions: are we on the cusp of a radical world historical shift?},

Yet it is rare to find someone prepared to defend all freedom of speech, especially if the views expressed are obnoxious or obviously false. So where do we draw the line? How important is our right to freedom of speech? In this accessible and up-to-date Very Short Introduction, Nigel Warburton covers a wide range of controversial free-speech issues, from Holocaust denial and pornography to the status of modern copyright law. The book offers a concise guide to many of the vexing issues concerning our right to speak freely, including: Should a civilized society set limits on freedom of speech? How can we balance free speech with the sensitivities of religious and minority groups? How have digital technology and the Internet changed the debate?About the Series: Combining authority with wit, accessibility, and style, Very Short Introductions offer an introduction to some of life's most interesting topics. Written by experts for the newcomer, they demonstrate the finest contemporary thinking about the central problems and issues in hundreds of key topics, from philosophy to Freud, quantum theory to Islam.},

With dozens of code examples showing each step, you can gain new insights into your data by creating visualizations.Learn how to quickly turn data into insights with D3We have the data. But it needs to be understood by humans. The best way to convert this data into an understandable format is to mold it into a data visualization.And D3 is the best tool for job if you need to create custom data visualizations.With Fullstack D3 and Data Visualization you and your team will be able to share key insights, uncover problems before they start, and impress your boss by creating gorgeous visualizations.What's InsideChapter 0: Introduction When would you want to use D3.js?There is a spectrum of libraries to create charts on the web: on one end, you have easy-to-use, basic libraries that will create a standard chart type.Chapter 1: Making your first chart In this chapter we make a line chart. Line charts are a great starting place because of their popularity, but also because of their simplicity.Chapter 2: Making a scatterplot When looking at the relationship between two metrics, a scatterplot is a good choice. In this chapter we show how to create a scatterplot.Chapter 3: Making a bar chart In this chapter we cover how to create a histogram, which is a bar chart that shows the distribution of one metric, with the metric values on the x axis and the frequency of values on the y axis.Chapter 4: Animations and Transitions When we update our charts, we can animate elements from their old to their new positions. These animations can be visually exciting, but more importantly, they have functional benefits.Chapter 5: Interactions The biggest advantage of creating charts with JavaScript is the ability to respond to user input.Chapter 6: Making a map Maps are also uniquely good at answering geography-based questions. In this chapter, we'll build a map and learn how to plot values within a location.Chapter 7: Data Visualization Basics Now that we're comfortable with how to create a chart, we should zoom out a bit and talk about what chart to create. Chapter 8: Common Charts In this chapter, we talk about common chart types and when to use them. Chapter 9: Dashboard DesignA dashboard is any web interface that makes sense out of dynamic data, and in this chapter we learn how to make one.Chapter 10: Advanced Visualization: Marginal Histogram First, we'll focus on enhancing a chart we've already made: our scatter plot. This chart will have multiple goals, all exploring the daily temperature ranges in our weather dataset.Chapter 11: Advanced Visualization: Radial Weather Chart We talked about radar charts in Chapter 10. For this project, we'll build a more complex radar chart.Chapter 12: Advanced Visualization: Animated Sankey Diagram In this project, we'll be simulating real data and creating an animated diagram to engage our viewers. Chapter 13: D3 and React What's the best way to draw a chart within React? It turns out that there is a fair bit of overlap in functionality between a React and D3 - we'll discuss how we can create blazing fast charts using the two together.Chapter 14: D3 and Angular In this chapter we show how to create optimized SVG charts using D3 and Angular.},

  abstract = {A new translation of two celebrated lectures on politics, academia, and the disenchantment of the world. The German sociologist Max Weber is one of the most venturesome, stimulating, and influential theorists of the modern condition. Among his most significant works are the so-called vocation lectures, published shortly after the end of World War I and delivered at the invitation of a group of student activists. The question the students asked Weber to address was simple and haunting: In a modern world characterized by the division of labor, economic expansion, and unrelenting change, was it still possible to consider an academic or political career as a genuine calling? In response Weber offered his famous diagnosis of “the disenchantment of the world,” along with a challenging account of the place of morality in the classroom and in research. In his second lecture he introduced the notion of political charisma, assigning it a central role in the modern state, even as he recognized that politics is more than anything “a slow and difficult drilling of holes into hard boards.”~ Damion Searls’s new translation brings out the power and nuance of these celebrated lectures. Paul Reitter and Chad Wellmon’s introduction describes their historical and biographical background, reception, and influence. Weber’s effort to rethink the idea of a public calling at the start of the tumultuous twentieth century is revealed to be as timely and stirring as ever.},

It also provides a classification of political forms based upon “systems of rule” and “rulership” that has shaped debate about the nature and role of charisma, tradition, legal authority, and bureaucracy.Keith Tribe’s major new translation presents Economy and Society as it stood when Weber died in June 1920, with three complete chapters and a fragment of a fourth. One of the English-speaking world’s leading experts on Weber’s thought, Tribe has produced a uniquely clear and faithful translation that balances accuracy with readability. He adds to this a substantial introduction and commentary that reflect the new Weber scholarship of the past few decades.This new edition will become the definitive translation of one of the few indisputably great intellectual works of the past 150 years.},

The fact that technology allows us to transcend the limits of natural perception and see what was previously unseeable creates a new dimension of aesthetic experience and practice: molecular aesthetics. This book, drawing on an exhibit and symposium at ZKM | Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe, documents aesthetic developments in what Félix Guattari called the "molecular revolution." Just as artists in the Bauhaus movement began to use such industrial materials as metal, Plexiglas, and alloys as raw materials, artists today have access to new realms of the molecular and nano. The industrial aesthetic of machinery and material has been transformed into an aesthetic of media and molecules.  Molecular Aesthetics suggests ways in which art can draw inspiration from the molecular sciences -- and ways in which science can use art to make experimental results more intelligible and comprehensible. The authors of the essays collected in the book discuss the creation of molecules of remarkable beauty and the functional properties that stem from a few geometrical principles of molecular design; address the history of molecular structure representation; examine the meaning of molecular aesthetics for scientists; and compare chemical structures to artworks.},

  abstract = {Understanding Weber provides an accessible and comprehensive explanation of the central issues of Weber's work. Using the most recent scholarship and editions of Weber's writings, Sam Whimster establishes the full range, depth and development of Max Weber's approach to the social and cultural sciences. This ground-breaking book: locates the central issues in Weber's writings and relates them to the golden era of social and cultural sciences argues that Weber remains the major exponent of the classical tradition still relevant today offers a new interpretation of the dynamic of Weber's career as historian, social-economist, methodologist and sociologist. Weber's sociology still stands as a successful and valid underwriting of the substantive fields of power, law, rulership, culture, religion, civilizational configurations, and economic sociology. At a time of the turning away from grand theory to empirical policy studies, this book asserts theauthority of Weber's conception and calls for a critical engagement with his legacy in order to understand the dynamics of a globalizing modernity. This is an indispensable guide to Weber's writings and will be an invaluable companion to The Essential Weber (2004). The book closely tracks the development of Weber's thinking, an exploration that will make it an obligatory choice for undergraduate and postgraduate students as well as researchers in the fields of sociological theory, economic sociology and cultural studies.},

As this book reveals, his vision was much more complex and interesting. He hoped that machines would release people from relentless and repetitive drudgery in order to achieve more creative pursuits. At the same time he realized the danger of dehumanizing and displacement. His book examines the implications of cybernetics for education, law, language, science, technology, as he anticipates the enormous impact--in effect, a third industrial revolution--that the computer has had on our lives.},

What, perhaps, they don't know is that he created the ponds featuring those water lilies and spent 30 years painting 250 oils of them; that his water-lily work Le Bassin aux Nymphease sold in 2008 4 million dollars;  that his painting Cliffs Near Dieppe was stolen not once but twice; and that he was almost blind when he painted some of his most famous works. Biographic: Monet presents an instant impression of his life, work and fame, with an array of irresistible facts and figures convered into infographics to reveal the artist behind the pictures},

During his more than forty years in the business, Williams has been one of the true innovators, winning three Academy Awards and serving as the link between Disney's golden age of animation by hand and the new computer animation exemplified by Toy Story. Perhaps even more important, though, has been his dedication in passing along his knowledge to a new generation of animators so that they in turn could push the medium in new directions. In this book, based on his sold-out master classes in the United States and across Europe, Williams provides the underlying principles of animation that every animator--from beginner to expert, classic animator to computer animation whiz --needs. Urging his readers to "invent but be believable," he illustrates his points with hundreds of drawings, distilling the secrets of the masters into a working system in order to create a book that will become the standard work on all forms of animation for professionals, students, and fans.},

  abstract = {An essential handbook for students and professionals on writing eloquently, accurately, and originally about contemporary artHow to Write About Contemporary Art is the definitive guide to writing engagingly about the art of our time. Invaluable for students, arts professionals and other aspiring writers, the book first navigates readers through the key elements of style and content, from the aims and structure of a piece to its tone and language. Brimming with practical tips that range across the complete spectrum of art-writing, the second part of the book is organized around its specific forms, including academic essays; press releases and news articles; texts for auction and exhibition catalogues, gallery guides and wall labels; op-ed journalism and exhibition reviews; and writing for websites and blogs. In counseling the reader against common pitfalls―such as jargon and poor structure―Gilda Williams points instead to the power of close looking and research, showing how to deploy language effectively; how to develop new ideas; and how to construct compelling texts. More than 30 illustrations throughout support closely analysed case studies of the best writing, in Source Texts by 64 authors, including Claire Bishop, Thomas Crow, T.J. Demos, Okwui Enwezor, Dave Hickey, John Kelsey, Chris Kraus, Rosalind Krauss, Stuart Morgan, Hito Steyerl, and Adam Szymczyk. Supplemented by a general bibliography, advice on the use and misuse of grammar, and tips on how to construct your own contemporary art library, How to Write About Contemporary Art is the essential handbook for all those interested in communicating about the art of today. 34 illustrations and 64 Source Texts},

  abstract = {"1+1=3. That is the equation that summarizes the theme of this book. The book’s message is to integrate the developmental principles of Agile with the result-focused approaches integral to performance consulting. Your outcomes in shaping human performance will be significant--and greater than if you only used one of these models. This is a book for anyone who seeks to work collaboratively with leaders to bring about continuously improving and sustainable organizational change." --Dana Gaines Robinson, coauthor of Performance ConsultingAgile Performance Improvement demonstrates the mutual benefits that accrue to the worlds of performance consulting and agile software development when the values and principles of both are blended synergistically under the guidance of practitioners skilled in both. The agile performance improvement model blends the principles of human performance technology with the frameworks and practices of Agile. The result is an approach that maximizes the value of interactions among the consultant, the work team, and the customer. Unlike traditional end-to-end waterfall processes, agile performance improvement delivers value continuously and in small increments, relentlessly focusing on outcomes of value to the customer. Building on structures of Agile that are used in software development, such as Scrum, the agile performance improvement model considers the human component of holistic solutions in establishing a continuous stream of value.Bob Winter, a performance consultant, was the product owner for the corporate education scrum supporting an agile transition initiative for hundreds of engineering teams. From this cross-disciplinary experience, he discovered that the two cultures, two languages, and two methodologies of performance consulting and agile software development are—far from being incongruent, incompatible, or irrelevant to each other—in fact ideally suited to complement and support each other. Being agile improves the effectiveness of the performance consultant, and applying the lessons of human performance technology improves the effectiveness of software development teams.In Agile Performance Improvement, Winter teaches performance consultants how to apply agile principles, values, and methods usefully to the tasks of optimizing human performance in areas of practice not only adjoining but also well beyond the realm of software and IT engineering, such as corporate learning solutions, human resources systems, and non-software products. Conversely, he shows engineering teams immersed in an agile environment how to boost their performance using the principles and techniques taught and cultivated by performance consultants. The author, who has worked extensively on both sides of the traditional divide, recounts entertainingly but informatively how both sparks and fur can fly when geeks encounter people people.},

Following an introduction that situates Kittler′s work against the tumultuous background of German 20th–century history (from the Second World War and the cultural upheaval of the late 1960s to reunification), the book provides succinct summaries of Kittler′s early discourse–analytical work inspired by French post–structuralism, his media–related theorising and his most recent writings on cultural techniques and the notation systems of Ancient Greece.This clear and engaging overview of a fascinating theorist will be welcomed by students and scholars alike of media, communication and cultural studies.},

All these variables were negatively influenced when depictions were labeled as copies compared to identical ones labeled as originals. The authors’ findings show the importance of symbolic and personal values as modulators in art appreciation.},

However, the rapid propagation and great diversity of public opinions on social media pose great challenges to effective analysis of opinion diffusion. In this paper, we introduce a visual analysis system called OpinionFlow to empower analysts to detect opinion propagation patterns and glean insights. Inspired by the information diffusion model and the theory of selective exposure, we develop an opinion diffusion model to approximate opinion propagation among Twitter users. Accordingly, we design an opinion flow visualization that combines a Sankey graph with a tailored density map in one view to visually convey diffusion of opinions among many users. A stacked tree is used to allow analysts to select topics of interest at different levels. The stacked tree is synchronized with the opinion flow visualization to help users examine and compare diffusion patterns across topics. Experiments and case studies on Twitter data demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of OpinionFlow.},

Many opinion keywords carry varying polarities in different contexts, posing huge challenges for sentiment analysis research. Previous work on contextual polarity disambiguation makes use of term-level context, such as words and patterns, and resolves the polarity with a range of rule-based, statistics-based or machine learning methods. The major shortcoming of these methods lies in that the term-level features sometimes are ineffective in resolving the polarity. In this work, opinion-level context is explored, in which intra-opinion features and inter-opinion features are finely defined. To enable effective use of opinion-level features, the Bayesian model is adopted to resolve the polarity in a probabilistic manner. Experiments with the Opinmine corpus demonstrate that opinion-level features can make a significant contribution in word polarity disambiguation in four domains.},

  abstract = {One of the most influential data visualization books―updated with new techniques, technologies, and examplesVisualize This demonstrates how to explain data visually, so that you can present and communicate information in a way that is appealing and easy to understand. Today, there is a continuous flow of data available to answer almost any question. Thoughtful charts, maps, and analysis can help us make sense of this data. But the data does not speak for itself. As leading data expert Nathan Yau explains in this book, graphics provide little value unless they are built upon a firm understanding of the data behind them. Visualize This teaches you a data-first approach from a practical point of view. You'll start by exploring what your data has to say, and then you'll design visualizations that are both remarkable and meaningful. With this book, you'll discover what tools are available to you without becoming overwhelmed with options. You'll be exposed to a variety of software and code and jump right into real-world datasets so that you can learn visualization by doing. You'll learn to ask and answer questions with data, so that you can make charts that are both beautiful and useful. Visualize This also provides you with opportunities to apply what you learn to your own data. This completely updated, full-color second edition: Presents a unique approach to visualizing and telling stories with data, from data visualization expert Nathan YauOffers step-by-step tutorials and practical design tips for creating statistical graphics, geographical maps, and information designDetails tools that can be used to visualize data graphics for reports, presentations, and stories, for the web or for print, with major updates for the latest R packages, Python libraries, JavaScript libraries, illustration software, and point-and-click applicationsContains numerous examples and descriptions of patterns and outliers and explains how to show them Information designers, analysts, journalists, statisticians, data scientists―as well as anyone studying for careers in these fields―will gain a valuable background in the concepts and techniques of data visualization, thanks to this legendary book.},

At least, the code can answer weirdly for that foolish question. If Dewey’s decimal classification can sort out the whole human intelligence, the information, each subject in that classification can be seemed as a thin cobweb. I can get specific number by googling each subject which is categorized in second depth of Dewey’s Decimal Classification. Even though each number approximates to other numbers, there is no doubt that each number for each subject has its own identity. Now, I presume that this number is an identification number for the specific subject, then utilize this number as a variable for the production of trigonometrical shape. This shape in trigonometrical function can be regarded as a proper visual pattern for its own subject matter. Though it is hard to say that this pattern is correct or meaningful, I am sure that these visual patterns can be the alternative navigation to our intellectual outcome which is mirrored on the thinly-webbed internet space.},

If you are reading this statement, you might say “Yes.” If so, what is the difference which lies between character and code? After the first moment when the humankind start silent-reading, as I think, the process of reading became something different. If the declamation is a process of embodiment, the process of silent reading is a process of dis-cryption. Well, what is dis-cryption? Dis-cryption may be pronounced as same as the word, “description.” As all of you might know, the process of description is defined as an account which explains what they are or what they look like. I think description has an aspect of solving hidden code. For example, when we read the play written by Beckett, the English-born writer, the scene that we re-construct with our intellectual ability in our head has to be described to perceptive field by ourself. In this process, the encryption is essential. Each letter, basically the sign, consist the whole code which can be regarded as the crypted continuum. Alike the chain of DNA, the object with the semantic domain has the characteristic of the ciphered composition. In the contemporary media art, the previously-hidden aspect of artwork as an encrypted one encounters the chance to be emerged. For the reconsideration of this factor, I want to recall the most primitive form of encrytion and decryption, or just dis-cryption, the play.},

On the one hand, it is noticed that the aesthetic object  has changed its form from material into interpretive and semantic entity. On the other hand, the aesthetic experience is shifting  its site to the center of aesthetic object. Contemporary computer-based media art works are composed of physical bodies such  as computer CPU, monitor, projector, camera and speaker including technologies of computer vision, computer graphics, virtual  reality, artificial intelligence, augmented reality, etc. In particular, interactive art not only embodies characteristics  of already changed aesthetic object, but also reveals contexts of returning the problem of aesthetic object into the aesthetic  perception for the reconsideration. Therefore interactive art is the triggering and motivating point to discuss new aesthetic  object in terms of art and science.

  abstract = {Sentiment analysis of online user generated content is important for many social media analytics tasks. Researchers have largely relied on textual sentiment analysis to develop systems to predict political elections, measure economic indicators, and so on. Recently, social media users are increasingly using images and videos to express their opinions and share their experiences. Sentiment analysis of such large scale visual content can help better extract user sentiments toward events or topics, such as those in image tweets, so that prediction of sentiment from visual content is complementary to textual sentiment analysis. Motivated by the needs in leveraging large scale yet noisy training data to solve the extremely challenging problem of image sentiment analysis, we employ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). We first design a suitable CNN architecture for image sentiment analysis. We obtain half a million training samples by using a baseline sentiment algorithm to label Flickr images. To make use of such noisy machine labeled data, we employ a progressive strategy to fine-tune the deep network. Furthermore, we improve the performance on Twitter images by inducing domain transfer with a small number of manually labeled Twitter images. We have conducted extensive experiments on manually labeled Twitter images. The results show that the proposed CNN can achieve better performance in image sentiment analysis than competing algorithms.},

Rather than following a computer science curriculum, this book is aimed at creatives who are working in the intersection of design, art, and education.~In this book you'll learn to apply computation into the creative process by following a four-step process, and through this, land in the cross section of coding and art, with a focus on practical examples and relevant work structures. You'll follow~a real-world use case of computation art and see how it relates back to the four key pillars, and addresses potential pitfalls and challenges in the creative process. All code examples are presented in a fully integrated Processing example library, making it easy for readers to get started.This unique and finely balanced approach between skill acquisition and the creative process and development makes~Coding Art~a~functional reference book for both creative programming and the creative process for professors and students alike.What You’ll LearnReview ideas and approaches from creative programming to different professional domainsWork with computational tools like the Processing languageUnderstand the skills needed to move from static elements to animation to interactionUse interactivity as input to bring creative concepts closer to refinement and depthSimplify and extend the design of aesthetics, rhythms, and smoothness with data structuresLeverage the diversity of art code on other platforms like the web or mobile applicationsUnderstand the end-to-end process of computation art through real world use casesStudy best practices, common pitfalls, and challenges of the creative processWho This Book Is ForThoselooking to see what computation and data can do for their creative expression; learners who want to integrate computation and data into their practices in different perspectives; and those who already know how to program, seeking creativity and inspiration in the context of computation and data.},

  abstract = {Deep Time of the Media takes us on an archaeological quest into the                 hidden layers of media development -- dynamic moments of intense activity in media                 design and construction that have been largely ignored in the historical-media                 archaeological record. Siegfried Zielinski argues that the history of the media does                 not proceed predictably from primitive tools to complex machinery; in Deep Time of                 the Media, he illuminates turning points of media history -- fractures in the                 predictable -- that help us see the new in the old.Drawing on original source                 materials, Zielinski explores the technology of devices for hearing and seeing                 through two thousand years of cultural and technological history. He discovers the                 contributions of "dreamers and modelers" of media worlds, from the ancient Greek                 philosopher Empedocles and natural philosophers of the Renaissance and Baroque                 periods to Russian avant-gardists of the early twentieth century. "Media are spaces                 of action for constructed attempts to connect what is separated," Zielinski writes.                 He describes models and machinesthat make this conncection: including a theater of                 mirrors in sixteenth-century Naples, an automaton for musical composition created by                 the seventeenth-century Jesuit Athanasius Kircher, and the eighteenth-century                 electrical tele-writing machine of Joseph Mazzolari, among others. Uncovering these                 moments in the media-archaeological record, Zielinski says, brings us into a new                 relationship with present-day moments; these discoveries in the "deep time" media                 history shed light on today's media landscape and may help us map our expedition to                 the media future.},

  abstract = {'A modernist work of art is by definition 'incomprehensible'; it functions as a shock, as the irruption of a trauma which undermines the complacency of our daily routine and resists being integrated. What postmodernism does, however, is the very opposite: it objects par excellence are products with mass appeal; the aim of the postmodernist treatment is to estrange their initial homeliness: 'you think what you see is a simple melodrama your granny would have no difficulty in following? Yet without taking into account the difference between symptom and sinthom/the structure of the Borromean knot/the fact that Woman is one of the Names-of-the-Father ... you've totally missed the point!' if there is an author whose name epitomises this interpretive pleasure of 'estranging' the most banal content, it is Alfred Hitchcock (and—useless to deny it—this book partakes unrestrainedly in this madness).'  Hitchcock is placed on the analyst's couch in this extraordinary volume of case studies, as its contributors bring to bear an unrivalled enthusiasm and theoretical sweep on the entire Hitchcock oeuvre, from Rear Window to Psycho, as an exemplar of 'postmodern' defamiliarization. Starting from the premise that 'everything has meaning', the films' ostensible narrative content and formal procedures are analysed to reveal a rich proliferation of ideological and psychical mechanisms at work. But Hitchcock is here to lure the reader into 'serious' Marxist and Lacanian considerations on the construction of meaning. Timely, provocative and original, this is sure to become a landmark of Hitchcock studies.  Contributors: Frederic Jameson, Pascal Bonitzer, Miran Bozovic, Michel Chion, Mlladen Dolar, Stojan Pellko, Renata Salecl, Alenka Zupancic and Slavoj Zizek.},

  abstract = {“The only thing of which one can be guilty of is having given ground relative to one’s desire.”―Jacques Lacan The How to Read series provides a context and an explanation that will facilitate and enrich your understanding of texts vital to the canon. These books use excerpts from the major texts to explain essential topics, such as Jacques Lacan's core ideas about enjoyment, which re-created our concept of psychoanalysis. Lacan’s motto of the ethics of psychoanalysis involves a profound paradox. Traditionally, psychoanalysis was expected to allow the patient to overcome the obstacles which prevented access to "normal" sexual enjoyment; today, however, we are bombarded by different versions of the injunction "Enjoy!" Psychoanalysis is the only discourse in which you are allowed not to enjoy. Slavoj Žižek’s passionate defense of Lacan reasserts Lacan’s ethical urgency. For Lacan, psychoanalysis is a procedure of reading and each chapter reads a passage from Lacan as a tool to interpret another text from philosophy, art or popular ideology.},

  abstract = {Called "the Elvis of cultural theory" by The New York Times, popular philosopher and leftist rabble-rouser Slavoj Zizek, looks at one of the most desperate situations of our time: the current refugee crisis overwhelming Europe. In this short yet stirring book, Zizek argues that accepting all comers or blocking all entry are both untenable solutions... but there is a third option.Today, hundreds of thousands of people, desperate to escape war, violence and poverty, are crossing the Mediterranean to seek refuge in Europe. Our response, from our protected Western European standpoint, argues Slavoj Zizek, offers two versions of ideological blackmail: either we open our doors as widely as possible; or we try to pull up the drawbridge. Both solutions are bad, states Zizek. They merely prolong the problem, rather than tackling it.The refugee crisis also presents an opportunity, a unique chance for Europe to redefine itself: but, if we are to do so, we have to start raising unpleasant and difficult questions. We must also acknowledge that large migrations are our future: only then can we commit to a carefully prepared process of change, one founded not on a community that see the excluded as a threat, but one that takes as its basis the shared substance of our social being.The only way, in other words, to get to the heart of one of the greatest issues confronting Europe today is to insist on the global solidarity of the exploited and oppressed. Maybe such solidarity is a utopia. But, warns Zizek, if we don't engage in it, then we are really lost. And we will deserve to be lost.},
