# Implement "Pure Matcha Latte" Theme

The goal is to implement a new visual theme called "Pure Matcha Latte" for the website. This theme will feature a color palette inspired by matcha tea, milk, and natural tones, creating a calm and refreshing aesthetic.

## User Review Required

> [!NOTE]
> I will be modifying [src/styles/theme.css](file:///d:/yonggeun/porter/git/o-m.kr/src/styles/theme.css) to introduce the new color variables and FlyonUI theme configuration.

## Proposed Changes

### Styles
#### [MODIFY] [theme.css](file:///d:/yonggeun/porter/git/o-m.kr/src/styles/theme.css)
- Define new color variables for the "Pure Matcha Latte" theme.
  - **Primary**: Matcha Green (e.g., `#7D9D5B`)
  - **Secondary**: Milky White/Cream (e.g., `#F5F5F0`)
  - **Accent**: Dark Tea Green (e.g., `#4A5D3B`)
  - **Neutral**: Earthy Grey/Brown (e.g., `#8C8C88`)
- Configure FlyonUI theme to use these colors.
- Set "Pure Matcha Latte" as the default theme.

#### [MODIFY] [global.css](file:///d:/yonggeun/porter/git/o-m.kr/src/styles/global.css)
- Ensure the theme is applied correctly to the `body` or root element.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
- Start the dev server (`npm run dev`).
- Open the browser and navigate to the landing page and article pages.
- Verify that the new colors are applied to:
  - Navigation bar
  - Buttons and links
  - Backgrounds and text
  - Footer
- Check for contrast and readability.
