# Implement Instapaper-like Themes

The goal is to replicate the reading experience of Instapaper by implementing its four core color themes and adjusting the layout for a focus on readability.

## User Review Required

> [!NOTE]
> I will be defining four distinct themes in [src/styles/theme.css](file:///d:/yonggeun/porter/git/o-m.kr/src/styles/theme.css): `paper`, `coffee`, `gray`, and `midnight`.

## Proposed Changes

### Styles
#### [MODIFY] [theme.css](file:///d:/yonggeun/porter/git/o-m.kr/src/styles/theme.css)
- Define the four Instapaper themes using FlyonUI/Tailwind CSS variables:
  - **Paper**: White background, black text (Classic).
  - **Coffee**: Sepia/Cream background, dark brown text (Warm).
  - **Gray**: Light gray background, dark gray text (Low contrast).
  - **Midnight**: Black/Dark Blue background, white/light gray text (Dark mode).
- Configure font settings to match Instapaper's focus on typography (serifs for body, sans-serif for UI).

#### [MODIFY] [global.css](file:///d:/yonggeun/porter/git/o-m.kr/src/styles/global.css)
- Adjust global layout styles to mimic Instapaper's clean, centered reading column.
- Ensure proper spacing and line-height for enhanced readability.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
- Start the dev server (`npm run dev`).
- Test switching between the four themes (requires a theme switcher mechanism, which might need to be added or manually tested).
- Verify readability and contrast on sample articles.
