# Implement Instapaper-like Themes

The goal is to replicate the reading experience of Instapaper by implementing its four core color themes and adjusting the layout for a focus on readability.

## Proposed Changes

### Styles
#### [MODIFY] [theme.css](file:///d:/yonggeun/porter/git/o-m.kr/src/styles/theme.css)
- Define the four Instapaper themes using CSS variables.
- **Paper** (Classic):
  - Background: `#FDFDFD` (Off-white)
  - Text: `#333333` (Dark Gray)
- **Coffee** (Sepia):
  - Background: `#F8F1E3` (Cream/Sepia)
  - Text: `#4F321C` (Dark Brown)
- **Gray** (Dark Gray):
  - Background: `#333333` (Charcoal)
  - Text: `#DDDDDD` (Light Gray)
- **Midnight** (OLED Black):
  - Background: `#000000` (Pure Black)
  - Text: `#888888` (Medium Gray)

#### [MODIFY] [global.css](file:///d:/yonggeun/porter/git/o-m.kr/src/styles/global.css)
- Apply the **Coffee** theme variables to the `:root` or `body` by default.
- Adjust typography:
  - Font: Serif for body (e.g., Georgia or similar system serif).
  - Line-height: 1.6.
  - Max-width: 700px (approximate reading width).

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
- Start the dev server (`npm run dev`).
- Verify the **Coffee** theme is active.
- Check contrast and readability against the "Instapaper feel".
