# Refactor Grid Mapper to Span-Only Height

The goal is to simplify the grid system by removing variable `rowHeight` track sizes. Height will be determined solely by the number of row tracks a cell spans (`rowSpan`), meaning all row tracks will have a uniform height.

## Proposed Changes

### [Component] Grid Mapper Logic

#### [MODIFY] [grid-mapper.js](file:///d:/yonggeun/porter/git/o-m.kr/production/src/utils/grid-mapper.js)
- Set `currentRowHeightUnit` to a constant `1` throughout [generateGridStructure](file:///d:/yonggeun/porter/git/o-m.kr/production/src/utils/grid-mapper.js#218-393).
- Update `area` calculation to simply `width * height` (where height is the `rowSpan`).
- Update `requiredMinWidth` to `Math.ceil(rules.minArea / selectedSpan)`.
- Update `prevRowState` to track `rowSpan` instead of the now-obsolete `rowHeight`.
- Ensure `rowHeights` returned by [gridMapper12](file:///d:/yonggeun/porter/git/o-m.kr/production/src/utils/grid-mapper.js#410-479) is an array of `1`s (for backward compatibility and potential future use).

### [Component] Styles

#### [MODIFY] [patchwork.css](file:///d:/yonggeun/porter/git/o-m.kr/production/src/styles/swiss/patchwork.css)
- Add `grid-auto-rows: minmax(100px, 1fr);` (or a similar uniform height rule) to `.patchwork-grid` to ensure that `span 2` is actually twice the height of `span 1`.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- No automated tests currently exist for this logic.

### Manual Verification
1. Run `npm run dev` and open `http://localhost:4321`.
2. Verify that the grid layout still fills the screen without holes.
3. Observe that all rows now have the same base height, and larger articles span exactly N times that base height.
4. Check that the "Last Cell Adjustment" still prevents horizontal gaps.
