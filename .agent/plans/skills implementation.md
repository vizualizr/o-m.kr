Authoring Google Antigravity Skills

## About this codelab

_subject_Last updated Jan 20, 2026

## [1\. Introduction](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/getting-started-with-antigravity-skills#0)

Google Antigravity is an agentic IDE from Google. In this codelab, we will use Antigravity to build Agent Skills, a lightweight, open format for extending AI agent capabilities with specialized knowledge and workflows. You will be able to learn what Agent Skills are, their benefits and how they are constructed. You will then build multiple Agent Skills ranging from a Git formatter, template generator, tool code scaffolding and more, all usable within Antigravity.

**Prerequisites:**

-   Google Antigravity installed and configured.
-   Basic understanding of Google Antigravity. It is recommended to complete the codelab: [**Getting Started with Google Antigravity**](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/getting-started-google-antigravity).

## [2\. Why Skills](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/getting-started-with-antigravity-skills#1)

Modern AI agents have evolved from simple listeners to complex reasoners that integrate with local file systems and external tools (via MCP servers). However, indiscriminately loading an agent with entire codebases and hundreds of tools leads to **Context Saturation** and "Tool Bloat." Even with large context windows, dumping 40–50k tokens of unused tools into active memory causes high latency, financial waste, and "context rot," where the model becomes confused by irrelevant data.

## The Solution: Agent Skills

To solve this, Anthropic introduced **Agent Skills**, shifting the architecture from monolithic context loading to **Progressive Disclosure**. Instead of forcing the model to "memorize" every specific workflow (like database migrations or security audits) at the start of a session, these capabilities are packaged into modular, discoverable units.

## How It Works

The model is initially exposed only to a lightweight "menu" of metadata. It loads the heavy procedural knowledge (instructions and scripts) only when the user's intent specifically matches a skill. This ensures that a developer asking to refactor authentication middleware gets security context without loading unrelated CSS pipelines, keeping the context lean, fast, and cost-effective.

## [3\. Agent Skills and Antigravity](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/getting-started-with-antigravity-skills#2)

In the Antigravity ecosystem, if the Agent Manager is the brain and the Editor is the canvas, **Skills** act as specialized training modules that bridge the gap between the generalist Gemini 3 model and your specific context. They allow the agent to "equip" a defined set of instructions and protocols—such as database migration standards or security checks—only when a relevant task is requested. By dynamically loading these execution protocols, Skills effectively transform the AI from a generic programmer into a specialist that rigorously adheres to an organization's codified best practices and safety standards.

## What is a Skill in Antigravity?

In the context of Google Antigravity, a Skill is a directory-based package containing a definition file (`SKILL.md`) and optional supporting assets (scripts, references, templates).

It is a mechanism for on-demand capability extension.

-   **On-Demand**: Unlike a System Prompt (which is always loaded), a Skill is only loaded into the agent's context when the agent determines it is relevant to the user's current request. This optimizes the context window and prevents the agent from being distracted by irrelevant instructions. In large projects with dozens of tools, this selective loading is crucial for performance and reasoning accuracy.
-   **Capability Extension**: Skills can do more than just instruct; they can execute. By bundling Python or Bash scripts, a Skill can give the agent the ability to perform complex, multi-step actions on the local machine or external networks without the user needing to manually run commands. This transforms the agent from a text generator into a tool user.

While Model Context Protocol (MCP) functions as the agent's "hands"—providing heavy-duty, persistent connections to external systems like GitHub or PostgreSQL—Skills act as the "brains" that direct them.

MCP handles the stateful infrastructure, whereas Skills are lightweight, ephemeral task definitions that package the methodology for using those tools. This serverless approach allows agents to execute ad-hoc tasks (like generating changelogs or migrations) without the operational overhead of running persistent processes, loading the context only when the task is active and releasing it immediately after.

Functionally, Skills occupy a unique middle ground between "Rules" (passive, always-on guardrails) and "Workflows" (active, user-triggered macros). Unlike workflows that require specific commands (e.g., `/test`), Skills are **agent-triggered**: the model automatically detects the user's intent and dynamically equips the specific expertise required. This architecture allows for powerful composability; for example, a global Rule can enforce the use of a "Safe-Migration" Skill during database changes, or a single Workflow can orchestrate multiple Skills to build a robust deployment pipeline.

## [4\. Creating Skills](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/getting-started-with-antigravity-skills#3)

Creating a Skill in Antigravity follows a specific directory structure and file format. This standardization ensures that skills are portable and that the agent can reliably parse and execute them. The design is intentionally simple, relying on widely understood formats like Markdown and YAML, lowering the barrier to entry for developers wishing to extend their IDE's capabilities.

## Directory Structure

Skills can be defined at two scopes, allowing for both project-specific and user-specific customizations :

1.  **Workspace Scope**: Located in `<workspace-root>/.agent/skills/`. These skills are available only within the specific project. This is ideal for project-specific scripts, such as deployment to a specific environment, database management for that app, or generating boilerplate code for a proprietary framework.
2.  **Global Scope**: Located in `~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/`. These skills are available across all projects on the user's machine. This is suitable for general utilities like "Format JSON," "Generate UUIDs," "Review Code Style," or integration with personal productivity tools.

A typical Skill directory looks like this:

```
<span><span>my</span></span><span><span>-</span></span><span><span>skill</span></span><span><span>/</span></span><span><br></span><span><span>├──</span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span>SKILL</span></span><span><span>.</span></span><span><span>md</span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span>#</span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span>The</span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span>definition</span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span>file</span></span><span><br></span><span><span>├──</span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span>scripts</span></span><span><span>/</span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span>#</span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span>[</span></span><span><span>Optional</span></span><span><span>]</span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span>Python</span></span><span><span>,</span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span>Bash</span></span><span><span>,</span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span>or</span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span>Node</span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span>scripts</span></span><span><br></span><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></span><span><span>├──</span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span>run</span></span><span><span>.</span></span><span><span>py</span></span><span><br></span><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></span><span><span>└──</span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span>util</span></span><span><span>.</span></span><span><span>sh</span></span><span><br></span><span><span>├──</span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span>references</span></span><span><span>/</span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span>#</span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span>[</span></span><span><span>Optional</span></span><span><span>]</span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span>Documentation</span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span>or</span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span>templates</span></span><span><br></span><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></span><span><span>└──</span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span>api</span></span><span><span>-</span></span><span><span>docs</span></span><span><span>.</span></span><span><span>md</span></span><span><br></span><span><span>└──</span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span>assets</span></span><span><span>/</span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span>#</span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span>[</span></span><span><span>Optional</span></span><span><span>]</span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span>Static</span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span>assets</span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span>(</span></span><span><span>images</span></span><span><span>,</span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span>logos</span></span><span><span>)</span></span><span><br></span>
```

This structure separates concerns effectively. The logic (`scripts`) is separated from the instruction (`SKILL.md`) and the knowledge (`references`), mirroring standard software engineering practices.

### The SKILL.md Definition File

The SKILL.md file is the brain of the Skill. It tells the agent what the skill is, when to use it, and how to execute it.

It consists of two parts:

-   YAML Frontmatter
-   Markdown Body.

**YAML Frontmatter**

This is the metadata layer. It is the only part of the skill that is indexed by the agent's high-level router. When a user sends a prompt, the agent semantic-matches the prompt against the description fields of all available skills.

```
<span>---</span><span><br>name</span><span>:</span><span> database</span><span>-</span><span>inspector<br>description</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Use</span><span> </span><span>this</span><span> skill </span><span>when</span><span> the user asks to query the database</span><span>,</span><span> check table schemas</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>or</span><span> inspect user data </span><span>in</span><span> the </span><span>local</span><span> </span><span>PostgreSQL</span><span> instance</span><span>.</span><span><br></span><span>---</span><span><br></span>
```

Key Fields:

-   **name**: This is not mandatory. Must be unique within the scope. Lowercase, hyphens allowed (e.g., `postgres-query`, `pr-reviewer`). If it's not provided, it will default to the directory name.
-   **description**: This is mandatory and the most important field. It functions as the "trigger phrase." It must be descriptive enough for the LLM to recognize semantic relevance. A vague description like "Database tools" is insufficient. A precise description like "Executes read-only SQL queries against the local PostgreSQL database to retrieve user or transaction data. Use this for debugging data states" ensures the skill is picked up correctly.

**The Markdown Body**

The body contains the instructions. This is "prompt engineering" persisted to a file. When the skill is activated, this content is injected into the agent's context window.

The body should include:

1.  Goal: A clear statement of what the skill achieves.
2.  Instructions: Step-by-step logic.
3.  Examples: Few-shot examples of inputs and outputs to guide the model's performance.
4.  Constraints: "Do not" rules (e.g., "Do not run DELETE queries").

**Example SKILL.md Body:**

```
<span>Database</span><span> </span><span>Inspector</span><span><br><br></span><span>Goal</span><span><br></span><span>To</span><span> safely query the </span><span>local</span><span> database </span><span>and</span><span> provide insights on the current data state</span><span>.</span><span><br><br></span><span>Instructions</span><span><br></span><span><span>-</span></span><span> </span><span>Analyze</span><span> the user</span><span>'s natural language request to understand the data need.<br></span><span><span>-</span></span><span> Formulate a valid SQL query.<br>&nbsp;</span><span><span>-</span></span><span> CRITICAL: Only SELECT statements are allowed.<br></span><span><span>-</span></span><span> Use the script scripts/query_runner.py to execute the SQL.<br>&nbsp;</span><span><span>-</span></span><span> Command: python scripts/query_runner.py "SELECT * FROM..."<br></span><span><span>-</span></span><span> Present the results in a Markdown table.<br><br>Constraints<br></span><span><span>-</span></span><span> Never output raw user passwords or API keys.<br></span><span><span>-</span></span><span> If the query returns &gt; 50 rows, summarize the data instead of listing it all.<br></span>
```

## Script Integration

One of the most powerful features of Skills is the ability to delegate execution to scripts. This allows the agent to perform actions that are difficult or impossible for an LLM to do directly (like binary execution, complex mathematical calculation, or interacting with legacy systems).

Scripts are placed in the `scripts/` subdirectory. The `SKILL.md` references them by relative path.

## [5\. Authoring Skills](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/getting-started-with-antigravity-skills#4)

The goal of this section is to build out Skills that integrate into Antigravity and progressively show various features like resources / scripts / etc.

You can download the Skills from the Github repo here: [https://github.com/rominirani/antigravity-skills](https://github.com/rominirani/antigravity-skills).

We can look at placing each of these skills inside of either `~/.gemini/antigravity/skills` folder or `/.agent/skills` folder.

## **Level 1 : The Basic Router (** `git-commit-formatter` **)**

Let's consider this as the "Hello World" of Skills.

Developers often write lazy commit messages e.g. "wip", "fix bug", "updates". Enforcing "Conventional Commits" manually is tedious and often forgotten. Let's implement a Skill that enforces the Conventional Commits specification. By simply instructing the agent on the rules, we allow it to act as the enforcer.

**How to Run This Example:**

1.  Make a small change to any file in your workspace.
2.  Open the chat and type: Commit these changes.
3.  The Agent will not just run git commit. It will first activate the git-commit-formatter skill.
4.  Result: A conventional Git commit message will be proposed.

For e.g. I made Antigravity add some comments to a sample Python file and it ended up with a Git commit message like `docs: add detailed comments to demo_primes.py.`

This is the "Reference" pattern.

Every source file in a corporate project might need a specific 20-line Apache 2.0 license header. Putting this static text directly into the prompt (or `SKILL.md`) is wasteful. It consumes tokens every time the skill is indexed, and the model might "hallucinate" typos in legal text.

Offloading the static text to a plain text file in a `resources/` folder. The skill instructs the agent to read this file only when needed.

Converting loose data (like a JSON API response) to strict code (like Pydantic models) involves dozens of decisions. How should we name the classes? Should we use `Optional`? `snake_case` or `camelCase`? Writing out these 50 rules in English is tedious and error-prone.

LLMs are pattern-matching engines.

Showing them a golden example (Input -> Output) is often more effective than verbose instructions.

**How to Run This Example:**

1.  Create a new dummy python file: `touch my_script.py`
2.  Type: `Add the license header to my_script.py`.
3.  The agent will read `license-header-adder/resources/HEADER_TEMPLATE.txt`.
4.  It will paste the content exactly, verbatim, into your file.

## Level 3: Learning by Example (json-to-pydantic)

The "Few-Shot" pattern.

Converting loose data (like a JSON API response) to strict code (like Pydantic models) involves dozens of decisions. How should we name the classes? Should we use `Optional`? `snake_case` or `camelCase`? Writing out these 50 rules in English is tedious and error-prone.

**How to Run This Example:**

1.  Provide the agent with a snippet of JSON (paste it in chat or point to a file).

`{ "product": "Widget", "cost": 10.99, "stock": null }`

2.  Type: `Convert this JSON to a Pydantic model`.
3.  The agent looks at the `examples` pair in the skill folder.
4.  It generates a Python class that perfectly mimics the coding style, imports, and structure of `output_model.py`, including handling the null stock as Optional.

A sample output (`product_model.py`) is shown below:

## Level 4: Procedural Logic (database-schema-validator)

This is the "Tool Use" Pattern.

If you ask an LLM "Is this schema safe?", it might say all is well, even if a critical primary key is missing, simply because the SQL looks correct.

Let's delegate this check to a deterministic Script. We use the Skill to route the agent to run a Python script that we wrote. The script provides binary (True/False) truth.

**How to Run This Example:**

1.  Create a bad SQL file `bad_schema.sql`: `CREATE TABLE users (name TEXT);`
2.  Type: `Validate bad_schema.sql`.
3.  The agent does not guess. It will invoke the script, which fails (Exit Code 1) and it will report to us that "The validation failed because the table ‘users' is missing a primary key."

This pattern covers most of the features available in Skills.

Complex tasks often require a sequence of operations that combine everything we've seen: creating files, following templates, and writing logic. Creating a new Tool for the ADK (Agent Development Kit) requires all of this.

We combine:

-   Script (to handle the file creation/scaffolding)
-   Template (to handle boilerplate in resources)

**How to Run this Example:**

1.  Type: `Create a new ADK tool called StockPrice to fetch data from an API`.
2.  Step 1 (Scaffolding): The agent runs the python script. This instantly creates `StockPriceTool.py` with the correct class structure, imports, and class name `StockPriceTool`.
3.  Step 2 (Implementation): The agent "reads" the file it just made. It sees `# TODO: Implement logic.`
4.  Step 3 (Guidance): It's not sure how to define the JSON schema for the tool arguments. It checks `examples/WeatherTool.py`.
5.  Completion: It edits the file to add `requests.get(...)` and defines the ticker argument in the schema, exactly matching the ADK style.
